Our external subsea provider is also looking to restore their link quickly.</p><p>\"Anyone who needs to call 999 should try their landline or their mobile, even if they don't have signal from their own mobile provider. We're sorry for any inconvenience.\"</p><p>Emergency services have had to implement temporary back-up arrangements.</p><p>Police Scotland said it was working with partners including the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and HM Coastguard to bring additional emergency support to the island.</p><p>The force said an emergency hub had been set up in the Tesco car park in South Road, Lerwick.</p><p>Ch Insp Jane Mackenzie told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that police officers would be more visible on the island in the meantime.</p><p>She said: \"We're still trying to work to establish the full extent of the problem - we know there are some telephone lines working, 999 lines are believed to be working and some mobile networks are still working.</p><p>\"So anyone calling 999 should be able to do so from a mobile phone. What we would ask is if you have an emergency you should first try a landline or mobile to call 999.</p><p>\"If that doesn't work, you should flag down an emergency service vehicle that isn't using their blue light or attend either a police station, hospital, fire or ambulance station to report the emergency.\"</p><p>Ch Insp Mackenzie urged the public not to use phone lines for non-urgent calls and to check on elderly or vulnerable people more frequently as assistance alarms may not be operating effectively.</p><p>The cable that was damaged between Faroe and Shetland last week will be repaired on Saturday, according to Faroese Telecom's head of infrastructure Páll Vesturbú.</p><p>He said: \"The damage is affecting most of telecom services to Shetland. There are some services still working but we will try to establish more services during the day if that's possible.</p><p>\"We expect it will be fishing vessels that damaged the cable but it is very rare that we have two problems at the same time.\"</p><p>MP Alistair Carmichael added that the damage had caused \"catastrophic impact\".</p><p>He said: \"Communication is critical to modern life, to business, to the emergency services and education - just about every aspect of modern life.</p><p>\"It's like somebody has flipped a switch and taken us back 20 or 30 years. You live in an island community, you know sometimes these things happen and that's why we have to learn the lessons from this.\"</p><p>Modern submarine cables use fibre optic technology and are typically as wide as a garden hose, according to telecoms market research firm TeleGeography.</p><p>It explains lasers on one end fire at extremely rapid rates down thin glass fibres to receptors at the other end of the cable.</p><p>These glass fibres are wrapped in layers of plastic - and sometimes steel wire - for protection.</p><p>Cables lie on the ocean floor, while nearer to the shore they are buried under the seabed for additional protection.</p><p>The firm said \"considerable care\" is taken to make sure cables avoid fault zones, fishing zones, anchoring areas and other dangers.</p><p>Ian Brown, a partner with Lerwick-based internet provider Shetland Broadband, said he became aware of a problem just after 00:00 on Thursday when his home broadband went off.</p><p>He said the north cable was broken on 15 October in a clean break, but the southern one was not a clean break because there are around 100 fibres in the cable - and not all had been broken.</p><p>Shetland Broadband is still operational because the fibres it uses were not damaged.</p><p>Mr Brown said the impact ranged from minor inconvenience for islanders to disruption to businesses and local NHS services that rely on their online connection.</p><p>He said Shetland Broadband was working with the NHS to try and resolve its issues.</p><p>In another example, he said a delivery of 2,000 parcels to the islands encountered problems as they could not be scanned.</p><p>Mr Brown said: \"We don't know if the cable was hooked up by a ship or lifted and caught by the currents.

        "content": "<p>For years the headlines have covered the controversies over advanced Russian air defence systems heading to Iran. But now the arms traffic is very much in the other direction, writes Jonathan Marcus of the Strategy and Security Institute, University of Exeter.</p><p>Iranian-supplied drones are being used by Moscow to terrorise Ukrainian civilians and to strike at the country's electricity generating and distribution system.</p><p>Russia's predicament in Ukraine has prompted Moscow to turn to Tehran for stocks of precision-guided weapons. Its own arsenals are fast running out.</p><p>There have been a number of instances where coastal defence and air defence missiles have been used by the Russians to strike at land targets in Ukraine - a role for which they are not best suited.</p><p>Transport flights have been monitored heading from Iran to Russia. Reports from US sources suggest that Iranian trainers from the IRGC - the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps - have deployed to a base in Crimea to teach Russian personnel how to operate the systems.</p><p>Wreckage from drones that have been shot down - both Iranian Shahed-131 loitering munitions (colloquially known as kamikaze drones) and the larger Shahed-136 - has been analysed. There is no doubt that Tehran, despite its denials, is compensating for a significant shortfall in Russia's arsenal.</p><p>This is clearly not good news for Ukraine. While a significant number of the Iranian-supplied drones have been shot down there could be worse to come.</p><p>Iran has more capable loitering munitions in its arsenal. And there are fears that even more dangerous Iranian weapons - ballistic missiles - could soon be on their way to Russia.</p><p>These carry much larger warheads than the drones and Ukraine's anti-ballistic missile capability is limited. This could add a new level of complexity to Western efforts to bolster Ukraine's anti-air and anti-missile defences.</p><p>But what of the wider ramifications of this deepening relationship between Moscow and Tehran?</p><p>There could be implications for the future of the moribund nuclear agreement between the international community and Tehran. Furthermore the delicate balance of forces in Syria could be altered with significant consequences for Israel and, in turn, for its relationship with Moscow.</p><p>Clearly both Russia and Iran need friends. They are both isolated and embattled.</p><p>Russia is facing economic sanctions due to its aggression against Ukraine, a war which is not going well for Moscow. Iran's regime is also under sanction for its nuclear programme and human rights record, and it is facing massive discontent at home.</p><p>They are both part of a small \"club\" of authoritarian nations, along with China, that seek not just to pursue their own regional strategic goals but also, more broadly, to strike back against what they see as a US-dominated global order.</p><p>Iran's security clamp-down at home has already drawn additional economic sanctions from the West. Now its weapons transfers to Russia are being seen by the United Kingdom and France as a breach of UN Security Council resolution 2231 that was passed in the wake of the 2015 nuclear deal.</p><p>This could potentially lead to some nuclear-related sanctions being restored. These new tensions will further undermine efforts to return to the JCPOA, the international deal designed to constrain Iran's nuclear activities which was abandoned by the Trump Administration in May 2018.</p><p>Efforts to restore the deal have lapsed at least until after the US Mid-Term elections on 8 November. Meanwhile Iran has continued to make progress in its enrichment activities.</p><p>The Iran nuclear dossier is a looming shadow for the West as its focus is firmly fixed upon Ukraine. Russia - one of the key parties to the original deal - is hardly going to pressure its new arms supplier to give ground.</p><p>Nonetheless, the relationship between Moscow and Tehran is driven by circumstance rather than any deep ideological bond.</p><p>Russia's relationship with Iran has long had a measure of ambivalence; a good example is their differing ambitions in Syria.</p><p>Russia's military intervention saved the Assad regime. Iranian manpower, weaponry and militias were also crucial to his survival.</p><p>But Russia, which still maintains a presence in Syria, has never been enthusiastic about Tehran's regional ambitions there. However it has not acted to contain Iranian influence in quite the way Israel would have wished. That said, it has done little to thwart Israeli air strikes aimed at reversing Iran's build-up in Syria.</p><p>Could the new dynamic in Russia-Iranian relations change this? While some Russian air defences and troops have been removed from Syria Moscow still has the capacity to interfere with Israeli operations.</p><p>This has been one of the guiding concerns influencing Israel's tentative support for Ukraine.</p><p>But what of the future? Suppose for example that Russia decided to transfer even more advanced weaponry to Iran in return for its assistance, what then? Might this prompt a shift in Israel's attitude to Kyiv?</p><p>That for now, with an Israeli general election looming, seems unlikely. But the new Russia-Iran relationship has the potential to impact global affairs way beyond the war in Ukraine.</p><p>Jonathan Marcus is a former BBC Defence & Diplomatic Correspondent and now an honorary professor at the Centre for Strategy and Security at the University of Exeter.</p>",

        "content": "<p>JoqniX has silver-platinum hair, wears spectacles and loves meeting new people.</p><p>He livestreams - or broadcasts - himself playing popular video games on his YouTube channel for up to 12 hours. His few hundred followers enjoy watching him play or speak about the action unfolding in the game.</p><p>But JoqniX isn't real. He is a digital avatar created and managed by a student based in southern India who is not comfortable revealing more details about his location and offline life.</p><p>JoqniX is among a fast-growing niche group of virtual YouTubers, or VTubers, in India - digital personalities that have been created by online entertainers and content creators who mostly wish to keep their identities secret.</p><p>These VTuber avatars usually have distinct Japanese anime-style features and they stream games, participate in internet trends, make art or music and engage in other activities online that are fun to watch. Creators say that part of the popularity of these digital personalities is that their real identities remain shrouded in mystery.</p><p>According to reports, the trend originated in Japan in 2016 with Kizuna AI, widely considered to be the first VTuber, using the term for the first time. Since then, the trend has grown in popularity with several content creators setting up quirky digital VTuber avatars, some of whom have amassed a huge fan following.</p><p>Venu G Joshi, founder of the Indian VTuber talent agency, Project Starscape, says the trend gained popularity in India during the Covid 19 pandemic. Joqnix's creator, who wished to be known only by the digital avatar, estimates that there are more than 90 VTubers in India at the moment.</p><p>He maintains a list of Indian VTubers on Twitter and is a moderator of Discord servers - an online space for like-minded people to interact with each other via video and text chats - for the community.</p><p>The phenomenon is yet to gain mainstream popularity in India, but participants hope this could change soon. The BBC spoke to some creators of Indian VTuber accounts to better understand the trend, its appeal and purpose.</p><p>For the creator behind VTuber Suzuki Zuriko, VTubing allows her to escape the vicious trolling content creators are often subjected to online. \"I feel it has enabled many of us, especially women, to try out content creation without feeling unsafe,\" she says. \"I don't have to worry about people making fun of my real body or making sexist comments.\"</p><p>For Virtual Sakura's creator, on the other hand, the appeal of VTubing lies in the scope for creativity the trend offers. Creators can give their avatars interesting backstories - Virtual Sakura, for instance, is a 200-year-old girl with magical powers. \"Here we can make our own realities and it's beautiful,\" says the Delhi-based creator.</p><p>Creators either design their avatars - also called \"models\" - or commission artists and animators to design and create 2D or 3D versions of these models. Most models are Japanese anime-style designs, while others are modelled after other creations such as mythical creatures. A slew of apps are used to design them and their movements are controlled using face and body tracking software.</p><p>The 19-year-old creator of VTuber Mio - an avatar that is half cat demon and half human - has designed 10 such models so far. \"I've earned roughly $2,000 (£1,700) from making models and art commissions over the past two years,\" she says.</p><p>JoqniX's creator says that his digital avatar speaks in his own voice, even though most creators choose to use voice modulation software to give their avatars a unique voice. JoqniX speaks in a sing-song voice and often sprinkles his conversations with Japanese words.</p><p>The creator describes himself as being a \"shy and silent\" person, but says that JoqniX brings him out of his shell, at least online. \"When I started streaming, I promised myself that I'll speak up and make friends,\" he says.</p><p>While Japanese VTubers are immensely popular - many of them have millions of followers on their YouTube channels and several others are part of paid ad campaigns and launch events - Indian VTubers are yet to enjoy this level of commercial success.</p><p>The creators the BBC spoke to recall how Nijisanji - a popular VTuber agency based in Japan - announced its India branch in 2019 and launched three VTubers, including Noor, who raked up more than 60,000 subscribers - only to suspend operations in 2021. Observers speculate this was due to \"failed marketing\". AnyColor Inc, the entertainment start-up which owns Nijisanji, declined to answer the BBC's questions.</p><p>Most Indian VTubers start out on YouTube but are now active on streaming platforms like Twitch as well. Their videos rarely cross 1,000 views on YouTube and the creators work independently. But experts in the space say that the niche is slowly expanding.</p><p>Project Starscape has launched two batches - popularly called \"gens\" - of VTubers so far. The agency held auditions to shortlist candidates and helped them set up their YouTube channels.</p><p>\"We received a total of around 260 applications,\" says Mr Joshi. So far, the company's VTubers are all women but he says he plans to launch a batch of all-male VTubers soon.</p><p>\"Female VTubers tend to do better because gaming has a majority male fan base,\" says Mr Joshi, adding that he has just closed an angel round of funding with a Japanese investor.</p><p>An introductory video by Zucci Agasura, one of the agency's VTubers, has 52,000 views on YouTube. \"Depending on your engagement, you can earn money through YouTube's Channel Membership - where fans pay for access to exclusive perks and content,\" says the creator, but declines to divulge more details about her earnings from the platform.</p><p>Last year, the 25-year-old creator behind VTuber MeowCatMax founded Virtualism - a company that offers a platform for upcoming VTubers to showcase their skills and build their fanbase.</p><p>\"We put out news, podcasts and are also conducting auditions to launch our first gen of VTubers,\" he says.</p><p>Harsh, who maintains a page for the Indian VTubing community on Reddit - a social news aggregation and discussion website - says that Indian VTubers haven't gained traction yet because \"the concept of living for your hobbies is still budding here\".</p><p>But he remains a huge fan. \"Watching a VTuber is like watching a friend and when VTubers collaborate, it can feel like watching a reality show.\"</p>",

I wouldn't have invited them without knowing them so that is something that people definitely need to be cautious about.</p><p>\"It's a relationship that has developed over a few years and we even had a virtual Fifa stag for me where we played drinking games and stuff.\"</p><p>For Ryan, who said it can often be difficult for adult friends to meet up due to work and family commitments, gaming is \"probably the most accessible form really for me to be able to socialise\".</p><p>\"If you are struggling, or you feel a little bit lonely you can log on and meet some new people and it's a great platform for that. There's loads of different games and the market's massive.</p><p>\"It's a good way to go around things and definitely for me now with kids, it's something that I really do rely on to be able to chat people.</p><p>\"You can get a good couple of hours of good social time, and also it can be decompressing.\"</p><p>He said especially during lockdown, it was a \"release and a bit of normality\" and he knows they \"have each other's back\".</p><p>Scott, who made the trip from Cambridgeshire with childhood friend Matt, said the foursome speak every day, laughing and \"taking the mick of of each other\".</p><p>Scott has made friends through games before but \"never like this\", and said their relationship \"was so influential in lockdown\" and \"a stroke of luck\" that they were all able to get to know each other.</p><p>He said: \"When Ryan invited us we were never going to say no.</p><p>\"It was a beautiful thing watching Ryan and Alice get married and I'm looking forward to next time.\"</p><p>The friends are planning to meet up next year in Belfast to see the band Blink182.</p><p>\"I don't really like Blink182 but I am looking forward to the weekend away and finally meeting Gerard,\" said Scott.</p><p>While a recent study found gaming itself has little impact on wellbeing, Mind Cymru said the social aspect cannot be downplayed.</p><p>Stephen Buckley, from the charity, said: \"Playing games may positively impact our mental health by giving us time to relax, connect with others, or try out new life skills.</p><p>\"They may also allow us to build a positive community, socialise and connect with others and this in turn could help us to talk about our feelings, especially if we're going through a difficult time.</p><p>\"Gaming may also give us time and space to relax, which is really important for our mental wellbeing.\"</p><p>However, he said experiences do vary and it was \"crucial to look after ourselves when we're gaming\", and seek help if you experience feelings of isolation, low mood or spend money excessively.</p><p>\"It's also important to think carefully about what you share online, even with people you feel that you know,\" he added.</p>",

The planned mine and processing facility could satisfy up to 5% of global demand for neodymium and praseodymium (NdPr), which are used in high-power magnets.</p><p>They are two of a group of so-called rare earth elements, that are essential to the electronics industry.</p><p>NdPr, europium, terbium and other rare earth metals that were once barely heard of are now commonplace in the manufacture of phone touchscreens, wind turbines and other modern technologies.</p><p>The mining of these minerals is an industry currently dominated by China, but geopolitical and trade forces are at work that could reshape the international market.</p><p>Australia, a superpower exporter of iron ore and coal with rich mining traditions believes it is well-placed to join the race to exploit minerals that provide critical parts for electric vehicles and wind turbines.</p><p>\"This could certainly be a game-changer for Australia. We are relatively well-endowed in rare earth elements,\" says Gavin Lockyer, managing director of Arafura Resources.</p><p>\"This could really put Australia front and centre in the renewable sector.</p><p>\"It is relatively easy to discover a rare earths deposit. What is difficult is finding a deposit that has economic quantities of the valuable materials.\"</p><p>Rare earths are a collection of more than a dozen elements on the periodic table. They are not particularly rare, but actually fairly plentiful in the Earth's crust.</p><p>Geoscience Australia, a government research agency, says they have broad industrial, medical, domestic and strategic applications \"because of their unique catalytic, nuclear, electrical, magnetic and luminescent properties\".</p><p>They are used in \"magnets and super magnets, motors, metal alloys, electronic and computing equipment, batteries, catalytic converters, petroleum refining, medical imaging and lasers\".</p><p>Europium is found in fluorescent lighting, gadolinium in nuclear power rods and ytterbium in solar panels.</p><p>Mr Lockyer points out that some of the latest technology relies on their properties.</p><p>\"It is important to note that an electric vehicle might only have AUD$200 (£120; $140) or so of NdPr in it, but without it that electric vehicle will not work efficiently. Similarly with the wind turbines,\" he adds.</p><p>In a time of war and menace, the valuable metals have strategic value and are used in fighter jets, guided missiles and drones along with other high-tech equipment for space exploration.</p><p>Australian firm Lynas Rare Earths has been contracted by the United States Department of Defense to build a multimillion-dollar processing facility in the US in a bid to reduce its reliance on China for strategic minerals.</p><p>Lynas is one of the few significant rare earths producers outside China and runs the Mt Weld mine in Western Australia.</p><p>\"We look forward to not only meeting the rare earth needs of the US government, but also reinvigorating the local rare earths market,\" Lynas managing director Amanda Lacaze told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.</p><p>The US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm warned recently at a conference in Sydney that China was \"big-footing\" renewable energy technology and supply chains.</p><p>Beijing's control of the supply of rare earths has been documented by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (Aspi), an independent think tank based in Canberra.</p><p>It noted how the minerals have become weapons of diplomacy following a 2010 collision between a Chinese fisherman and Japanese patrol boats near a disputed chain of islands. Beijing complained about the \"illegal interception\" of its trawlers and retaliated.</p><p>\"We saw the Chinese government stop rare earth supply to Japan as part of its economic coercion against the Japanese government,\" says Aspi analyst Albert Zhang.</p><p>\"Since then, what countries have noticed is that there is a risk by having only one major supplier of rare earths [and] such an essential raw material isn't beholden to just the political will of one government. Australia has the materials and the right sort of companies and capital investment to diversify the world's supply chain.\"</p><p>Australian experts have said that more recently China threatened to limit rare earth shipments to American defence contractors because of US arms sales to Taiwan.</p><p>John Coyne, who is in charge of Aspi's Northern Australia Strategic Policy Centre, also warns that China will not easily surrender its vice-like dominance of the international rare earths sector. He alleges that Beijing uses its \"power and market-distortion tactics to strategically flood the market when it wants to drive out competitors and deter new market entrants\".</p><p>\"Australia has the world's sixth-largest reserves of rare earth minerals. However, they remain largely untapped with only two mines producing them,\" he says.</p><p>\"There is significant potential in the establishment of multi-ore mineral-processing hubs in Australia. After all, there is no point in creating supply chain resilience for [rare earth] ores if miners must still send them to China for processing.\"</p><p>China's Global Times said Beijing would welcome \"benign competition\" to \"improve production capacity\" in the industry.</p><p>The newspaper added that \"the US and some of its allies, in their pernicious and selfish attempt to contain China's rise, has brought toxic geopolitics to the crucial rare earth industry as well as other economic and trade fields\".</p><p>More technology of business:</p><p>Earlier this year, the South Korean carmaker Hyundai signed a memorandum of understanding with Arafura Resources, which provides \"them security of supply [of rare earths] in a geopolitically stable environment\".</p><p>A similar agreement to supply NdPr was reached between Arafura and GE Renewable Energy in July.</p><p>\"What we have all seen during the pandemic is the importance of having multiple supply chains,\" says GE's Sam Maresh. \"Ultimately, it is in everyone's interest to have diverse supply chains.</p><p>\"We require rare earths to make very, very strong magnets that are used in our offshore wind turbines. NdPr allows you to make magnets that are super-strong [that] allow for the rotation and for the turbine to generate electricity using the wind,\" he told the BBC.</p><p>\"We know that the energy transition requires a lot of rare earths. We use about 600kg of super-magnets for every offshore wind turbine. So we need a lot of this product. We can't decarbonise without rare earths.\"</p>",

        "content": "<p>Elon Musk is set to take over Twitter, the small but mighty social media platform used by politicians, journalists and neighbourhood trolls alike to spread news, hot takes, and sometimes misinformation.</p><p>As he prepares to put his stamp on the company, let's review what we know about the billionaire.</p><p>Since bursting on the Silicon Valley scene more than two decades ago, the 50-year-old serial entrepreneur has kept the public captivated with his business antics.</p><p>Born in South Africa, Mr Musk showed his talents for entrepreneurship early, going door to door with his brother selling homemade chocolate Easter eggs and developing his first computer game at the age of 12.</p><p>He has described his childhood as difficult, coloured by his parents' divorce, bullying at school and his own difficulty reading social cues due to Asperger's Syndrome. He soon fled home for college, moving to Canada and then the US, where he studied economics and physics at the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League college.</p><p>In a 2010 essay for Marie Claire, his first wife Justine Musk, a writer who met Mr Musk in college and married him in 2000, wrote that even before his millions, Mr Musk was \"not a man who takes no for an answer\".</p><p>\"The will to compete and dominate that made him so successful in business did not magically shut off when he came home,\" she recalled, adding that he told her while dancing at their wedding, \"I am the alpha in this relationship.\"</p><p>After being accepted to a physics graduate degree programme at Stanford University, Mr Musk quickly dropped out and founded two technology start-up companies during the \"dot com boom\" of the 1990s. These included a web software firm and an online banking company that eventually became PayPal, which sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.5bn.</p><p>He ploughed his fortune into a new rocket company, SpaceX, which he aimed to make a cost-effective alternative to Nasa, and a new electric car company, Tesla, where he chaired the board until becoming chief executive in 2008.</p><p>The two firms are credited with upending their industries, even as they sometimes veered close to collapse.</p><p>\"I'm never hugely convinced that he knows what he wants to do tomorrow,\" says journalist Chris Stokel-Walker. \"He very much leads by instinct.\"</p><p>In a 2015 biography, author Ashlee Vance described Mr Musk as \"a confrontational know-it-all\" with an \"abundant ego\". But he also called him an awkward dancer and diffident public speaker.</p><p>Divorced three times - twice to the same woman - Mr Musk is frank about his vices, regularly discussing his fondness for marijuana.</p><p>In the press, he's been dubbed both a mad genius and Twitter's biggest troll, known as much for his lofty ambitions as his petty fights - not to mention the more serious lawsuits he and his companies have faced from regulators, investors and others over issues like racial discrimination and the trustworthiness of his claims.</p><p>\"If you list my sins, I sound like the worst person on Earth,\" Mr Musk said in a recent TED interview. \"But if you put those against the things I've done right, it makes much more sense.\"</p><p>All the messiness appears to be part of his appeal - and it certainly hasn't stopped him from amassing a fortune.</p><p>Forbes and Bloomberg now rank him as the world's richest person, with a net worth of about $250bn - tens of billions more than rivals such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.</p><p>That's based largely on the value of his shares in Tesla, of which he owns about 17%. The company's stock has exploded in value - some say unreasonably - since the start of 2020, rising by a factor of 10 as the firm's output increased and it started to deliver regular profits.</p><p>Mr Musk also champions digital currencies and has a hand in several other smaller companies, including tunnel-maker the Boring Company and experimental brain-computer start-up Neuralink.</p><p>Mr Musk, who wears the mantle of workaholic proudly, has often said he's not in business simply to make money - claims he repeated recently about Twitter.</p><p>\"Elon only gets involved with things if he feels that they're critically important for some reason... for the sake of society or humanity,\" says friend and Tesla investor Ross Gerber.</p><p>Mr Musk, who became a US citizen in 2002, has resisted efforts to label his politics - calling himself \"half Democrat half Republican\", \"politically moderate\" and \"independent\".</p><p>That doesn't mean he's shied away from political debate.</p><p>He has injected himself into some of the world's hottest geopolitical fights, suggesting that China should establish a \"special administrative zone\" in Taiwan; and proposing terms to resolve the war in Ukraine that were adamantly rejected by many of the country's top leaders.</p><p>In the US, he moved to Texas, complaining of California's regulations and high taxes; has clashed with union organisers; and in the spring of 2020 decried coronavirus lockdowns as \"fascist\".</p><p>He was one of the first business executives to part ways with former President Donald Trump, quitting a White House business council after Mr Trump withdrew the US from a global climate agreement.</p><p>But he's also made it clear he's not a fan of President Joe Biden, who he sees as snubbing Tesla while promoting electric vehicles.</p><p>His direct political donations are relatively small for a man of his wealth - just $100,000 since 2004, according to Politico, fairly evenly split between the parties, at least in the early years. He gave to former President Barack Obama in 2011 and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2015, though more recently has focused on Republicans.</p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union, a US non-profit organisation known for its championship of values such as free speech, has recognised him as a top supporter. However, reports suggest most of Mr Musk's donations have gone to his own charitable foundations, which will, eventually, disburse the funds.</p><p>He said recently that he sees his businesses as a form of philanthropy, because they are focused on solving major human issues like climate change, in the case of Tesla.</p><p>Last fall, when the head of the United Nations World Food Programme called on billionaires to make one-time donations to solve the world's food crisis, Mr Musk responded with scepticism to the challenge.</p><p>What that will all mean for Twitter - a platform already facing criticism from the left and right over its content moderation policies - is anyone's guess.</p><p>\"The easiest part for Musk was buying Twitter,\" says Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. \"The hard part is going to be fixing it.\"</p>",

        "content": "<p>Imagine if your face had been digitally edited into a porn video without your consent and then shared on the internet. One woman reveals the horror of it happening to her.</p><p>Scrolling through her Twitter feed one evening, Kate Isaacs stumbled across a disturbing video among her notifications.</p><p>\"This panic just washed over me,\" Kate says, speaking publicly for the first time about what happened. \"Someone had taken my face, put it on to a porn video, and made it look like it was me.\"</p><p>Kate had been deepfaked. Someone had used artificial intelligence to digitally manipulate her face onto someone else's - in this case a porn actress.</p><p>The deepfake video on Twitter - with Kate, who campaigns against non-consensual porn, tagged - had been made using footage from TV interviews she had given while campaigning. It appeared to show her having sex.</p><p>\"My heart sank. I couldn't think clearly,\" she says. \"I remember just feeling like this video was going to go everywhere - it was horrendous.\"</p><p>In the past, high-profile celebrities and politicians were the most common targets of deepfakes - the videos weren't always porn, some were made for comedic value. But over the years that's changed - according to cybersecurity company Deeptrace, 96% of all deepfakes are non-consensual porn.</p><p>Like revenge porn, deepfake pornography is what's known as image-based sexual abuse - an umbrella term which encompasses the taking, making and/or sharing of intimate images without consent.</p><p>It is already an offence in Scotland to share images or videos that show another person in an intimate situation without their consent. But in other parts of the UK, it's only an offence if it can be proved that such actions were intended to cause the victim distress - a loophole which means video creators often don't face legal consequences.</p><p>Government plans for a long-awaited UK-wide Online Safety Bill have been under endless revision and repeatedly shelved. The new laws would give the regulator, Ofcom, the power to take action against any website deemed to be enabling harm to UK users, no matter where they are based in the world. Earlier this month, however, Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan said she and her team were now \"working flat out\" to ensure the bill was delivered.</p><p>Kate, 30, founded the #NotYourPorn campaign in 2019. A year later, her activism contributed to the adult entertainment website, Pornhub, having to take down all videos uploaded to the site by unverified users - the majority of its content.</p><p>Kate therefore assumed that whoever was behind the deepfake of her had been annoyed by her campaigning. She had \"taken away their porn\".</p><p>But she had no idea who that person was, or who might have seen the video. And while she could see that her face had been overlaid onto footage of a porn actor, the video was convincing enough that she worried others might not spot the deception.</p><p>\"It was a violation - my identity was used in a way I didn't consent to.\"</p><p>Underneath the video, people began leaving streams of abusive comments, saying they were going to follow Kate home, rape her, film the attack, and publish the footage on the internet.</p><p>\"You start thinking about your family,\" she says, holding back tears. \"How would they feel if they saw this content?\"</p><p>The threat intensified when both Kate's home and work addresses were published below the video - a practice known as doxing.</p><p>\"I became completely paranoid - 'Who knows my address? Is it someone I know that's done this?'</p><p>\"I was thinking, 'I'm really in trouble here, this isn't just some people on the internet mouthing off, there's actually a real danger.'\"</p><p>From her experience supporting others in similar situations, Kate knew exactly what to do if someone becomes a victim - but in that moment she froze.</p><p>\"I didn't follow any of my own advice,\" she says. \"Kate the campaigner was very strong and didn't show any vulnerability - and then there was me, Kate, who was really scared.\"</p><p>A colleague reported the video, vicious comments and doxing to Twitter, and they were all taken down from the platform. But once any deepfake has been published and shared online it's difficult to remove it from circulation entirely.</p><p>\"I just wanted that video off the internet,\" Kate says, \"but there was nothing I could do about it.\"</p><p>There's a marketplace for deepfakes in online forums. People post requests for videos to be made of their wives, neighbours and co-workers and - unfathomable as it might seem - even their mothers, daughters and cousins.</p><p>Content creators respond with step-by-step instructions - what source material they'll need, advice on which filming angles work best, and price tags for the work.</p><p>A deepfake content creator based in south-east England, Gorkem, spoke to the BBC anonymously. He began creating celebrity deepfakes for his own gratification - he says they allow people to \"realise their fantasies in ways that really wasn't [sic] possible before\".</p><p>Later, Gorkem moved on to deepfaking women he was attracted to, including colleagues at his day job who he barely knew.</p><p>Deepfake Porn: Could You Be Next?</p><p>Harmless images are being turned into hardcore porn and used to harass women. Jess Davies explores the emotional and psychological toll being \"deepfaked\" has on unsuspecting victims.</p><p>Watch on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)</p><p>\"One was married, the other in a relationship,\" he says. \"Walking into work after having deepfaked these women - it did feel odd, but I just controlled my nerves. I can act like nothing's wrong - no-one would suspect.\"</p><p>Realising he could make money from what he refers to as his \"hobby\", Gorkem started taking commissions for custom deepfakes. Gathering footage from women's social media profiles provides him with plenty of source material. He says he even recently deepfaked a woman using a Zoom call recording.</p><p>\"With a good amount of video, looking straight at the camera, that's good data for me. Then the algorithm can just extrapolate from that and make a good reconstruction of the face on the destination video.\"</p><p>He accepts \"some women\" could be psychologically harmed by being deepfaked, but seems indifferent about the potential impact of the way he is objectifying them.</p><p>\"They can just say, 'It's not me - this has been faked.' They should just recognise that and get on with their day.</p><p>\"From a moral standpoint I don't think there's anything that would stop me,\" he says. \"If I'm going to make money from a commission I would do it, it's a no brainer.\"</p><p>The standard of deepfakes can vary wildly, and depends both on the expertise of the person who made the video and the sophistication of the technology used.</p><p>But the man behind the largest deepfake porn website admits it's no longer easy to know for certain whether you're looking at manipulated images or not. His site attracts about 13 million visitors a month and hosts roughly 20,000 videos at any one time. He is based in the US and rarely speaks to the media - but he agreed to talk to the BBC anonymously.</p><p>Deepfaking \"ordinary\" women is a red line for him, he says, but in his view, hosting pornographic deepfake videos of celebrities, social media influencers and politicians, is justifiable.</p><p>\"They're accustomed to negative media, their content is available in the mainstream. They're different to normal citizens,\" he says.</p><p>\"The way I see it, they are able to deal with it in a different way - they can just brush it off. I don't really feel consent is required - it's a fantasy, it's not real.\"</p><p>Does he think what he's doing is wrong? Part of him is \"in denial about the impact on women\", he admits - and notably, he reveals that his spouse doesn't know what he does for a living.</p><p>\"I haven't told my wife. I'm afraid of how it might affect her.\"</p><p>Until relatively recently, deepfake software wasn't easily available, and the average person wouldn't have had the skills to make them. But now, anyone over the age of 12 can legally download dozens of apps and make convincing deepfakes in a few clicks.</p><p>For Kate that's worrying and \"really scary\".</p><p>\"It's not the dark web, it's in the app stores - right in front of our faces.\"</p><p>She also fears the hoped-for Online Safety Bill won't keep up with technology. Three years ago, when the bill was first-drafted, deepfake-creation was seen as a professional skill in which someone would need to be trained - not merely download an app.</p><p>\"We're years down the line and the contents of [the bill] are out of date - there's so much missing,\" she says.</p><p>But for creator Gorkem, criminalising deepfaking would change things.</p><p>\"If I could be traced online I would stop there and probably find another hobby,\" he says.</p><p>Being deepfaked and doxed had an impact on Kate's health and her ability to trust other people. She believes those behind the attacks weren't only trying to intimidate and humiliate her, but also to silence her. For a time, she stepped back from campaigning, questioning whether she could carry on speaking out about misogyny.</p><p>But now, she is all the more fired up. She realised she cared too much to walk away.</p><p>\"I'm not letting them win.\"</p><p>Deepfakes can be used to control women, and tech firms - including those who make apps that enable face-swapping - should be encouraged to put safeguards in place, she says.</p><p>\"Any app should be able to detect sexual content.\"</p><p>\"If companies have not put money, resources and time into ensuring their app isn't being used as a place to create sexual abuse content, they are being deliberately irresponsible. They are culpable.\"</p><p>Neither Gorkem, nor the man behind the largest deepfake website, are understood to have been involved in deepfaking Kate Isaacs.</p><p>Source: #NotYourPorn Campaign</p>",

        "content": "<p>Decisions around the future of nuclear energy are urgently needed in Europe.</p><p>Russian supplies of natural gas have been disrupted amidst the war in Ukraine, energy prices have soared to emergency levels.</p><p>Meanwhile, some countries are suffering a lingering hangover from the Covid-19 pandemic. In France, half of the country's nuclear power plants are currently not operating.</p><p>The main reasons are corrosion, planned maintenance, and delayed maintenance due to pandemic-linked staffing issues, explains Phuc Vinh Nguyen, who researches European energy policy at the Jacques Delors Energy Center in France.</p><p>Mr Nguyen warns that across the EU the energy price crisis will probably last until at least 2024.</p><p>In this situation, some see the use of nuclear reactors as a way to decouple from Russian natural gas.</p><p>Russian influence also looms over many aspects of nuclear power generation: Russia dominates the supply of nuclear fuel, the enrichment of uranium, and the building of nuclear power plants in other countries.</p><p>At Leibstadt, Switzerland's largest and youngest nuclear power plant, half of the uranium supply currently comes from Russia. There, as elsewhere, there's a scramble to source more uranium from outside the Russian sphere of influence.</p><p>The backdrop to this is that the Russian occupation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility is raising fresh fears about the weaponisation of nuclear science.</p><p>Fabian Lüscher, who heads the nuclear energy section at the Swiss Energy Foundation (SES), says that Europe's ageing nuclear fleet is not adapted to deal with contemporary terrorist attacks and cyberattacks. \"You even have to think of those very unlikely possibilities when planning risky infrastructure,\" Mr Lüscher argues.</p><p>And then, of course, there's the problem of nuclear waste.</p><p>Angélique Huguin is part of a group of activists affiliated with the anti-nuclear movement Sortir du nucléaire, who have taken up residence near the Cigéo nuclear research laboratory in northeastern France.</p><p>The activists share a home in the charming commune of Bure, amidst stone houses with bright blue shutters.</p><p>Ms Huguin argues that it is irresponsible to leave the problem of nuclear waste for future generations. And she believes that the nuclear accidents at Chernobyl and Fukushima are \"evidence that you have to stop\" supporting nuclear power.</p><p>While countries like France and Hungary are continuing to bet on nuclear power, Austria and Luxembourg are opposed. Others, like Belgium and Switzerland, are more ambivalent.</p><p>The countries' fortunes are interlinked, as they often transact energy supply with each other. And, of course, risks of nuclear accidents extend across borders.</p><p>Germany is a key player here. It had planned to decommission all of its nuclear power plants by the end of 2022, yet has decided to extend the operation of two plants to at least April 2023. Uncertainty hangs in the air.</p><p>More technology of business:</p><p>People supporting the transition away from nuclear argue that this is an opportunity to ramp up wind and solar energy, which is much cheaper and less risky than nuclear.</p><p>Others argue that some share of nuclear energy is necessary for a stable power supply, during fluctuations in solar and wind energy.</p><p>While Germany is betting on green hydrogen to shore up its energy system, Mr Nguyen notes that costs and transport are very challenging. \"Hydrogen should be seen as a 'champagne' technology,\" he says.</p><p>Further complicating Europe's energy picture, politically driven misinformation has clouded the debate. Across the continent, energy discussions quickly turn ideological, linked to political affiliations and cultural attachments.</p><p>What's clear is that there is little time to waste given the urgency of the climate and energy crises. Ordinary Europeans can't afford to wait decades for green hydrogen to mature, for new nuclear plants to begin operating, or for small modular reactors to become viable.</p><p>And tough choices need to be made because of limited financial resources. Uncertainty around the phasing out of nuclear in Switzerland is limiting investment in renewables there, according to Mr Lüscher.</p><p>Meanwhile, \"new-build nuclear power plants in Europe are the most expensive way to create electricity\", he says.</p><p>It is hugely expensive to build and decommission a nuclear plant. Then there is the cost of managing the nuclear waste.</p><p>One transitional step is to limit energy use, and France plans to reduce this by 10% over two years.</p><p>In a speech on 6 October, Élisabeth Borne, the French Prime Minister, urged a broader transformation.</p><p>\"The reduction in energy consumption must be part of the long term… it is not a matter of principle or ideology. It is about the ecological transition. Our sovereignty is at stake. It is about our purchasing power,\" she said.</p><p>This may not be a comfort to those struggling with energy bills. And as winter comes, energy use is expected to peak across the continent.</p><p>Campaigners argue that governments should be encouraging homeowners to install more insulation and better manage their energy-hungry devices.</p><p>Mr Nguyen believes that this is a landmark moment not only to shape future energy infrastructure, but also to embed behavioural changes. \"We can build a narrative where sufficiency measures are part of the solution.\"</p>",

        "content": "<p>If you are the type of person who is forever forgetting to charge your wireless headphones, help may finally be on hand.</p><p>It comes as the first commercially available solar-powered headphones are now on sale. The models, by Swedish firm Urbanista and German sports giant Adidas, both have solar panels built into their headbands.</p><p>In each case the flexible panels are made by another Swedish company, Exeger, which has spent the past decade working to make them light, thin and powerful enough to do the job.</p><p>Exeger's boss Giovanni Fili says it is both a matter of convenience and, more importantly, doing the right thing environmentally.</p><p>\"Charging - everyone hates it,\" he says. \"But every time you don't charge [using mains electricity] it is a good thing for the world.</p><p>\"The new generation of young adults expect to be offered tools to do good [for the environment], and that is what we are offering.\"</p><p>Exeger's solar panels are called Powerfoyle, and they are just 1.3mm thick. The technology is based around strips of titanium dioxide covered in a natural dye. In very simple terms, the dye absorbs photons from light, which are then converted into electrons.</p><p>While approximately only half as efficient as standard silicon-based solar panels of the same size in full sunshine, the titanium dioxide panels are, in addition to being significantly thinner, much easier and cheaper to produce.</p><p>The solar-powered headphones still have a built-in battery that can power up to 80 hours of playback time. It is this that the Powerfoyle strip charges. Mr Fili says that currently the tech can create one hour's worth of power \"from just 20 minutes of English or Swedish summer sunshine\".</p><p>Yet the panels can also create some power from artificial light, such as indoor lighting, so the idea is that the headphones are always charging unless it is the dead of night. And the headphones also still have a power socket if back-up power is required after heavy usage.</p><p>Mr Fili adds that solar panels are unlikely to be added to mobile phones any time soon, because so many of us keep our handset in a pocket, and therefore it doesn't have access to light. Instead he envisages the panels being fitted to people's clothing and bags, and phones to be charged from these.</p><p>Finnish company Planno is already making fabrics that have built-in solar panelling.</p><p>The firm is led by Elina Ilén, who is also a professor at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia's Department of Textile and Paper Engineering, and a leading expert on wearable textile electronics.</p><p>Rather than producing clothing that can charge your mobile phone, the firm instead focuses on washable garments with built-in, solar-powered sensors. These can monitor various aspects of the wearer's health, such as heart rate, temperature, posture, sleep quality and body fat levels.</p><p>\"Although these solar cells do produce enough energy to power wearable devices, placing a solar cell behind a textile will never have the same efficiency of harvesting energy as a solar cell in direct sunlight,\" says Ms Ilén.</p><p>\"The textile's thickness, density, structure, colour and finishing treatments will all have an impact on the amount of energy-harvesting potential.\"</p><p>She adds: \"Textile-based wearables are one of the best solutions for continuous health monitoring because product acceptability is easier to achieve. Patients are already wearing clothing, this technology can be hidden beneath the fabric to ensure comfort and discretion.\"</p><p>At Loughborough University researchers are taking a different approach to power-generating fabrics. Instead of using solar cells, they are harvesting the static electricity created when a person moves, and turning that into useable power.</p><p>The technology is based around tiny power converters called triboelectric nanogenerators (tengs). These are made from fibres such as cotton, polyester and nylon, which are covered in a polymer coating that attracts static. These flexible, stretchable, washable tengs can then be woven or knitted into the fabric of items of clothing.</p><p>\"Our group is investigating how we can use regular textile materials and textile fabrication techniques to produce efficient tengs for wearable applications,\" says project leader Ishara Dharmasena.</p><p>\"The aim is to produce energy-generating textiles like T-shirts, base layers and trousers which are very similar to our regular clothing, but capable of generating electricity or acting as sensors to measure body movements.\"</p><p>Dr Dharmasena, a Royal Academy of Engineering research fellow and lecturer at Loughborough, adds that in the future tengs could be used in conjunction with solar panels to create hybrid power-generating clothing.</p><p>Denise Wilson, author of the book Wearable Solar Systems, hopes to see the market for solar-powered clothing expand greatly in the coming years.</p><p>\"I think that we could benefit from more imagination when it comes to marketing wearable solar packs,\" says Prof Wilson, from the University of Washington's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.</p><p>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.</p><p>\"We have not yet taken advantage of what they can fully offer us in the global community.\"</p><p>She adds that the biggest area for growth will likely be clothing that can charge mobile phones and other portable electronic devices. \"For the average consumer, it may mean being able to charge on the go.\"</p><p>But she adds that for such clothing to find widespread popularity, the solar panel systems will need to last at least one year without a significant loss of efficiency.</p>",

        "content": "<p>If you want to understand how governments can fuel the rise of new technologies, look no further than the taxi fleets of Beijing.</p><p>Five years ago, the city revealed plans to ban the introduction of fossil fuel-powered taxis. Today, thousands of the cars run on batteries instead. And the drivers of these electric vehicles (EVs) don't have to worry about wasting time at charging stations, either.</p><p>Many electric taxis in Beijing, and dozens of other Chinese cities, just go to a battery-swapping station where a machine plucks out the depleted battery and installs a charged one in mere minutes.</p><p>\"They want to drive out there and earn some money so they definitely don't want to wait two hours for EV charging,\" explains I-Yun Lisa Hsieh from National Taiwan University.</p><p>This is just one facet of the increasingly diverse and booming market for electric cars in China. Members of the public are also snapping up EVs in unprecedented numbers.</p><p>In July, the China Passenger Car Association predicted that 6 million new EVs would be registered in the country in 2022 - a revision of its previous forecast of 5.5 million EVs to be sold this year.</p><p>Tesla had its best ever month in China in September, according to its most recent figures, selling 83,135 cars.</p><p>Nearly a quarter of all cars newly registered in China are now electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles, meaning that the country is ahead of Europe and well ahead of the US in adoption of these technologies. Half the world's EVs are sold in China.</p><p>And this is largely driven by government mandates and incentives, says Ms Hsieh. For more than a decade, the Chinese government has subsidised EV purchases. The value of these subsidies has fallen over time, and they are due to end by 2023, but there are still plenty of reasons why buying an electric car is a financial no-brainer.</p><p>Many buyers of new fossil fuel vehicles in China have to pay out, not only for the car, but the licence plate as well. \"It's really expensive,\" says Ms Hsieh. A new licence plate in Shanghai costs nearly 100,000 yuan (£12,500; $14,000).</p><p>There are other perks if you opt for an EV instead, though they differ from city to city. In Liuzhou, authorities have allowed EV owners to drive in bus lanes. And they get access to free parking spaces as well.</p><p>Then there is the potentially irresistible price tag of some vehicles. The Wuling Hong Guang Mini EV bucks the trend of EVs being a relatively expensive option.</p><p>The entry-level version of this dinky, no-frills car costs the equivalent of just £4,200 and appeals to city-dwellers and first-time car owners, says Jon Hykawy, president and director of Stormcrow Capital, a consulting and research firm.</p><p>\"These are vehicles that could be sold through a big chunk of Asia as well,\" he adds.</p><p>The Hong Guang Mini is currently China's most popular EV. But there are a host of options at the other end of the price scale, such as Tesla's Model Y (£49,000) or Xpeng's P7 (£30,410). Both are in the list of top 10 best-selling EVs in China.</p><p>The Chinese EV market is enormously competitive and lots of companies are vying for a place in it. Even an airline, Juneyao, wants to start making electric cars, according to a recent report from the Reuters news agency.</p><p>\"It's a very good environment for these manufacturers to develop technology,\" says Pedro Pacheco, an analyst at Gartner, noting that the range offered by some battery EVs in China is particularly good.</p><p>And manufacturers are filling higher-end EVs with infotainment systems and other gadgetry in a further attempt to woo consumers.</p><p>But two big questions hover over the frenzy for electric cars in China. Firstly, will it last? And secondly, how will it shape the global EV market?</p><p>Ana Nicholls, director of industry analysis at the Economist Intelligence Unit, says she has been surprised at just how quickly EVs have flown out of dealerships in China lately but argues that, with the removal of subsidies for purchasers of new vehicles, the appetite for EVs could wane.</p><p>\"It's hard to see how the EV market can carry on expanding at quite this rate in the future,\" she says.</p><p>Charging infrastructure remains unevenly distributed and subject to supply issues - some charging stations were curtailed recently thanks to a fall in electricity production caused by the mega drought affecting parts of China.</p><p>More technology of business:</p><p>Usually, more EV owners means rising demand for electricity in general and China faces an uphill battle in supplying all of these new vehicles at the same time as the country is trying to cut coal consumption at its power plants.</p><p>This is one reason why some analysts, including Mr Hykawy, argue that hybrid electric vehicles are a better option than cars that run on batteries alone, since they will be less reliant on the grid.</p><p>They also require less lithium, given their smaller batteries, which could be important given potential shortages of lithium expected in the coming years.</p><p>As for how the Chinese EV market could influence the rest of the world, the jury is still out. But it is already starting, with Chinese firms marketing EVs in Latin America, Africa and elsewhere. High-end manufacturer Nio is also bringing its battery-swapping stations to Norway and has just opened its second such station in the country.</p><p>Mr Pacheco argues that more major car brands would have to adopt battery swapping for the technology to become widespread in Europe. But he highlights the success of ultra low-cost EVs in China - such as the vehicles offered by local brands Wuling and Chery.</p><p>\"In China, they already have affordable EVs,\" he says. \"In Europe, we're not there yet.\"</p><p>In emerging markets, these are exactly the kind of vehicles that could catch on. Time to conquer the world? Maybe. But there's another school of thought that says, well, the world can wait.</p><p>\"As long as the Chinese market is booming, they may as well just sell locally,\" says Ms Nicholls. \"I mean, why wouldn't you?\"</p><p>Analysts tend to agree that it will be very interesting to see what happens when the subsidies run out. That could push Chinese EV makers towards other markets - and maybe we'll all fall in love with EVs thanks, indirectly, to the policies of Chinese authorities. We'll have to wait and see.</p>",

Its shares fell a further 4% in after-market trading on Wednesday.</p><p>\"I think Tesla's had a hard quarter and the market is responding to that,\" Sarah Kunst, managing director of Cleo Capital, told the BBC's Today programme.</p><p>\"The auto industry in general right now is having a very hard time because supply chain problems persist and the batteries - particularly for electric vehicles - are hard to come by,\" she said.</p><p>\"And the reality is that Tesla used to be the only place to go to buy a higher-end electric car and that's increasingly not the case.\"</p><p>Tesla dominates the electric vehicle market in the US, but it faces far more competition in Europe and China, where such cars are more popular.</p><p>In the US, rivals have also been ramping up their efforts.</p><p>German carmaker BMW said on Wednesday that it would spend $1.7bn to expand its electric vehicle production in the US.</p><p>A few months ago Elon Musk - no shrinking violet when it comes to self-promotion - said demand for Teslas was through the roof.</p><p>\"Right now demand is exceeding production to a ridiculous degree,\" he said.</p><p>And yet from these figures, that doesn't seem to be happening.</p><p>In fact Tesla is making more cars than it's selling.</p><p>Not only that, but there are a series of financial pressures eating away at profitability. Supply chain issues and the costs of raw materials are hurting profits.</p><p>Tesla investors are much more concerned about its long-term potential than short term financial pressures though.</p><p>That's why the uncertainty about demand for Teslas is particularly damaging. It helps to explain why a seemingly solid set of results has seen a fall in Tesla's share price.</p><p>It also explains why Mr Musk looked to kibosh talk of demand issues on the earnings call. \"I can't emphasise enough we have excellent demand for [the fourth quarter] and we expect to sell every car we can make as far in the future as we can see,\" he said.</p><p>However, many Tesla investors worry that Mr Musk isn't spending enough time on the company - after committing to buy Twitter.

It's something people don't want to talk about because you're ashamed.</p><p>\"It was the fear, I brought my children up that you don't answer the door until I'm there - and every time I went out, I was looking over my shoulder to see if anybody was coming up the street, like debt collectors or bailiffs.\"</p><p>Her money troubles began when Julie, who lives in a two-bedroom home in Port Talbot, got divorced and her father, who used to help her, died.</p><p>\"It's so easy as I carried on being a single mum and started ignoring all of the bills - and before you know it, I was £28,000 in debt,\" she said.</p><p>\"The kids went without but had what they had to and I went to foodbanks.\"</p><p>But Julie said her children \"had to have something to open on Christmas Day or their birthdays\" and added there was \"no other way\" than to get a high interest loan.</p><p>\"I don't care if I borrowed £500 and have to pay £1,500 back,\" she said.</p><p>\"They may have gone without holidays or luxury food but Christmas... no. I couldn't see my babies go without. You've got to get for your children at Christmas.\"</p><p>Julie said she found it difficult to seek help or talk to someone about her problems, almost until it was too late when she considered taking her own life. But she said she could not go through with it.</p><p>\"I realised this was the lowest point you can go,\" she recalled.</p><p>\"Having lost my mother when I was young, I was now [considering] taking my children's mother from them - and more to the point, they will find me - I can't have that.\"</p><p>Julie remembers the day when she finally sought financial help to stop the suffering of not just her, but her family.</p><p>\"I was at work and my daughter, who was 16 at the time, she rang and said there were bailiffs at the house threatening her,\" Julie recalled.</p><p>\"So I told her not to answer the door and put the phone through the letterbox and I told them politely I'm at work and stop threatening my daughter. I told them the debt is mine, not her debt.</p><p>\"I was petrified, she was petrified and I thought this is not fair on the children. My family was gobsmacked when I told them I was in so much debt.\"</p><p>Although not a religious person, Julie got free help from Christians Against Poverty after seeing the not-for-profit organisation recommended on TV by money saving expert Martin Lewis.</p><p>They called Julie's creditors, froze her debts and helped her declare herself bankrupt. Christians Against Poverty estimate that 13% of the UK adults have fallen behind on their bills.</p><p>Now most loans have become more expensive since the Bank of England put up interest rates to 2.25% last month - the highest level for 14 years - and rates are forecast to rise to about 6% by the spring.</p><p>About 370,000 people in Wales - that's one in six, the highest rate in Scotland, England or Wales - are classed as financially excluded, according to financial analysts.</p><p>This means they do not have access to high street financial services and pay more for bills like utilities.</p><p>Analysts at LexisNexis also say data shows county court judgements (CCJs) have doubled in Wales in the past two years, with what they say is a \"worrying\" rise in CCJs for \"small debts\" under £500.</p><p>\"More people are applying for short-term loans at a higher price,\" said Steve Elliot of Cardiff-based LexisNexis.</p><p>He added: \"Life at the moment is difficult for an increasingly number of people and having clear financial records that are able to give people access to financial and utility services in a more affordable way is a significant step to help them reduce cost.\"</p><p>Christians Against Poverty (CAP) have said calls to their helpline are rising every month and in the past two months, they have tripled the amount of emergency fuel top-ups than they did last year.</p><p>Now the organisation is calling on the UK government to raise benefits in line with inflation and \"review their plans\" to cut the Energy Price Guarantee from a minimum of two years to six months.</p><p>\"We are increasingly seeing people coming to us that are struggling with fuel bills,\" said Karen Homans of CAP.</p><p>\"This is particularly bad for those that are reliant on using expensive oil to heat their often poorly insulated and drafty homes.</p><p>\"While we work with each person to look at their debts and help them maximise their income, more and more people are finding that they simply don't have enough income to match the skyrocketing energy and cost of living increases.\"</p><p>The stories of financial struggles resonates with Julie and all she hopes is people in difficulty call for help before they get as deep into debt as she did.</p><p>\"There are millions like me,\" she said. \"Debt can ruin your life - calling for help was the best call I made.</p><p>\"I'm petrified of slipping back into my old habits but I will never be there again. I don't know how I will stay out of debt but I'm hoping to.</p><p>\"I'm still struggling. I work 30 hours a week, I'm only just keeping my head above the surface. I had 23p Universal Credit last month, I can't afford to shop every week and use the food bank occasionally. I can't do everything I want but have money to live on.\"</p><p>Julie is now enjoying life as a grandmother to seven children, all under the age of six, which she could not have envisaged before she sought help with her debt.</p><p>If you have been affected by any of the issues in this story, the BBC Action Line has links to organisations which can offer support and advice</p>",

        "content": "<p>\"Bhadla is almost unliveable,\" says Keshav Prasad, the chief executive Saurya Urja, a renewable energy company.</p><p>He is talking about part of the Thar desert located in Rajasthan in the northwest of India.</p><p>Temperatures there can top 50C and frequent sandstorms add to the inhospitable conditions.</p><p>But what makes Bhadla an unforgiving place to live also makes it an ideal place to generate solar power.</p><p>Thanks to the abundant sunshine, Bhadla is home to the world's biggest solar power farm, in part built and operated by Mr Prasad's Saurya Urja.</p><p>Soaking up the sunshine are 10 million solar panels with the capacity to generate 2,245MW, enough to power 4.5 million households.</p><p>While keeping the solar panels clean in such a sandy and dusty environment is a challenge, Mr Prasad says running such a vast solar plant is still much simpler than operating almost any other kind of power station.</p><p>\"There is not much equipment involved. Solar panels, cables, inverters and transformers are almost all that are needed to run a plant,\" he says.</p><p>The plant, which was completed in 2018, has brought investment and opportunities to one of India's most remote regions.</p><p>\"Most of the boys in my village did not study much. They were not ambitious, as our life was limited to the village, and our parents are farmers or into breeding cattle. But since the construction of the park, I realised the world is much bigger than my village,\" says 18-year-old Mukhtiyar Ali.</p><p>\"Because of Bhadla Park many engineers, officers and educated people visit our villages, which has changed my perspective towards life.</p><p>\"I want to be an officer [in the solar park] who has authority, respect, someone who can bring change in other people's lives,\" he says.</p><p>But not everyone is thrilled about the giant solar park that has been built on their doorstep.</p><p>Most of the 14,000 acres used for the park were owned by the state, but it was also where local farmers grazed their cattle.</p><p>\"Most of our livelihood was cattle rearing,\" says Sadar Khan, the head of Bhadla village.</p><p>\"Because all the government lands have been taken back, we don't have enough land for cattle grazing. We are left with few animals,\" he says.</p><p>He accepts that jobs have been created by the park, but says many of those jobs do not pay enough to survive on.</p><p>\"There are not many solar jobs for locals except labourers, as most of us are uneducated.\"</p><p>Mr Khan also complains that many locals still have no electricity connection.</p><p>\"We produce electricity, but still a number of villages in the nearby area are without electricity. So it's good we are the largest solar park - but it should bring changes in our life.\"</p><p>Anil Dhaka, the managing director of Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation, disputes Mr Khan's complaints. His state-owned organisation oversees renewable energy projects in Rajasthan.</p><p>\"As far as Bhadla Park is concerned we have not received any official grievance or complaints regarding land compensation. The land used in Bhadla Park was government land,\" he says.</p><p>Mr Dhaka adds that investments in solar projects in western Rajasthan have caused land prices and rents to rise, so many smallholders have benefited.</p><p>He also explains that the issue of electricity connections is not a simple one. The electricity generated by the Bhadla solar plant is at a high voltage, so cannot be directly supplied to local villages.</p><p>But he points out that plants like Bhadla are significantly lowering the cost of electricity from renewable sources.</p><p>About 75% of India's electricity is generated by burning coal, but by 2030 the government wants 40% of its electricity to come from renewable sources like solar.</p><p>That is going to require a lot of land.</p><p>More technology of business:</p><p>If India were to put in place a target to be net-zero emissions by the middle of this century, then it would have to cover between 1.7% and 2.5% of the country's total land mass with solar panels, according to a study last year by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).</p><p>Currently 34 big solar projects are at various stages of development, so more conflict over their location is likely, experts say.</p><p>\"A massive shift to renewable energy requires enormous resources, and land is a crucial one,\" says Bhargavi S Rao, a senior fellow at the Environmental Support Group.</p><p>\"Rain-fed and irrigated lands are being identified as dry land, drought-prone wasteland, non-productive land and so on, all to ensure such lands can be made available for the land-guzzling, utility-scale renewable energy projects, especially solar and wind,\" says Mrs Rao.</p><p>\"The prevailing model of promoting mega-energy projects that are land-intensive is creating an anomalous situation wherein farmers, in certain regions of interest to energy developers, are being surrounded by powerful real estate developers, and also state-led instruments, to compel them to lease and even sell their land,\" she adds.</p><p>Mrs Rao says, so far, the problem is \"sporadic\" as the shift to renewable energy is at an early stage. But given the scale of planned developments the situation is going to get worse.</p><p>\"By 2030 farmers will be under severe pressure to part with their lands. This is going to be especially problematic for small and marginal farmers, who form a majority of the farming community.\"</p><p>When contacted by the BBC, the government did not want to respond to Mrs Rao's claims.</p><p>But back in Bhadla, Mr Prasad, the man in charge of Rajasthan's renewable energy projects insists the giant solar plant there has been good for the local community.</p><p>\"There are around 60 villages around the solar park that have benefited - jobs have been created, schools have been constructed.</p><p>\"There were no medical facilities but now mobile medical vans visit villages, so this is not all about green energy - it's also the progress of the people.\"</p>",

And it also should have vertical take-off,\" he told the BBC.</p><p>\"If you require an airport to take-off, what problem are you solving? And why is this a flying car?\"</p><p>The top surface of the Model A's car-like exterior is a mesh so that air can pass through to eight propellers inside the body which provide lift.</p><p>But flying any distance using these alone, without the assistance of wings, would require prohibitive amounts of power.</p><p>Alef's proposed solution is novel - for longer flights the Model A transforms into a biplane.</p><p>After a vertical lift-off, the Model A will turn onto its side, the two-person cockpit swivels so the driver remains facing forward, and the car becomes a biplane with the long sides of the vehicle forming the top and bottom wings.</p><p>The classic biplane shape, with two wings, one on top of the other, is easier to see in the Model A if you imagine the mesh in-between the solid sides being removed. Alef has also produced a video visualising the transition.</p><p>Forbes observed that the way it would fly resembles the Opener Blackfly, an existing vertical take-off electric aircraft.</p><p>It's an ingenious idea, but is it a practical one?</p><p>Bringing flying and driving together adds weight, electric power also means heavy batteries.</p><p>\"The design is right on the ragged edge of what the physics and technology can do, which is where you would expect it to be,\" says aeronautical engineer Professor Steve Wright of the University of the West of England.</p><p>The mesh, as visualised, might also cause significant aerodynamic drag, he adds.</p><p>Alef says it has managed the transition to biplane in \"scaled flights\" since 2018. And it has large prototypes capable of vertical flight - though they don't yet resemble the polished appearance of the firm's mock-ups and concepts.</p><p>But Prof Wright warns the jump from a prototype to a working product is easily underestimated.</p><p>Technical hurdles are only one obstacle to building highways in the sky busy with flying cars.</p><p>The regulation and certification of flying cars is likely to be rigorous, time-consuming and expensive, as it is for any aircraft.</p><p>To fly a biplane, even one that you can drive on the roads, will require a pilots licence - though Mr Dukhovny envisions that for short low-level hops over obstacles using vertical flight, a licence used for drone operators might suffice.</p><p>And authorities are likely to impose strict rules on where vehicles can be flown.</p><p>For these and other reasons, Prof Wright thinks the future of flying cars will not be a single vehicle that consumers own, drive and fly.</p><p>In the film Back to the Future, the character Doc Brown's fusion-powered DeLorean car leaves the road and swoops into the air.</p><p>\"That isn't how mass airborne transport is going to play out, which is a real shame. I really want my flying DeLorean as much as anybody does,\" Prof Wright says.</p><p>In reality, travelling by flying car, Prof Wright argues, would be more like hiring a taxi.</p><p>\"You pull out your phone, and a robot car would draw up and it would take you to somewhere the size of a small park and the drone comes down, sets itself down, you jump in there. So in other words, you summon a drone taxi.\"</p><p>Many companies are developing autonomous passenger drones. Recently Chinese firm Xpeng gave its first public demonstration of its X2 vehicle in Dubai.</p><p>But Mr Dukhovny strongly believes that the idea of being able to drive and fly in the same vehicle is an attractive one. When I ask him who will pay the Model A's initial $300,000 (£266,000) price tag, he says \"early adopters\".</p><p>He says people have been waiting for a flying car for a 100 years. Alef's ambitious goal is to start selling vehicles in 2025.</p>",

        "slug": "the-ships-full-of-gas-waiting-off-europes-coast",
        "content": "<p>The huge tankers are waiting. Off the coasts of Spain, Portugal, the UK and other European nations lie dozens of giant ships packed full of liquefied natural gas (LNG).</p><p>Cooled to roughly -160C for transportation, the fossil fuel is in very high demand. Yet the ships remain at sea with their prized cargo.</p><p>After invading Ukraine in February, Russia curtailed gas supplies to Europe, sparking an energy crisis that sent the price of gas soaring. That led to fears of energy shortages and eye-watering bills for consumers.</p><p>\"It's built up for about, I would say, five to six weeks,\" says Augustin Prate, vice president of energy and commodity markets at Kayrros, one of many observers who has watched the situation unfold.</p><p>He and colleagues track ships via AIS (Automatic Identification System) signals, which are broadcast by vessels to receivers, including on satellites.</p><p>\"Clearly it's a big story,\" he says.</p><p>So why are ships loaded with LNG just hanging around Europe, exactly? The answer, as you might have guessed, is a little complicated.</p><p>Someone else who has watched the accumulation of vessels is Fraser Carson, a research analyst at Wood Mackenzie. This month, he counted 268 LNG ships on the water worldwide - noticeably above the one-year average of 241. Of those currently at sea, 51 are in the vicinity of Europe.</p><p>He explains that European nations plunged into a gas-buying spree over the summer that aimed to fill onshore storage tanks with gas. This was to ensure that heaps of fuel would be available to cover energy needs this winter.</p><p>The original target was to fill storage facilities to 80% of their total capacity by 1 November. That target has been met, and exceeded, far ahead of schedule. The latest data suggests storage is now at nearly 95% in total.</p><p>Imported LNG has played a key role in getting Europe to this point.</p><p>But as LNG continues to be brought ashore, demand for facilities that heat the liquid and turn it back into gas remains high. There aren't very many such plants in Europe, partly because the continent has long relied on gas delivered via pipelines from Russia instead.</p><p>So that's one reason why LNG ships are waiting around - some are queuing for access to regasification terminals. In the meantime, Germany and the Netherlands have invested in new regasification facilities. Some, rapidly built using converted LNG ships pinned to docksides, are expected to become operational within months.</p><p>On top of this bottleneck, less gas is getting used up in Europe than it otherwise might at present because the weather has been very mild well into October.</p><p>Plus, as Antoine Halff, co-founder of Kayrros notes, industrial activities that rely on gas have relaxed. This is something he and his colleagues track by scouring satellite images of factories.</p><p>\"There's been a very dramatic reduction in cement and steel production in Europe,\" he says.</p><p>It all means that a market situation called contango has emerged for LNG, says Mr Carson. That is, when the future price of a commodity is higher than today's price.</p><p>\"You would get a higher price for a delivery for January than you would in November,\" he explains.</p><p>Michelle Wiese Bockmann, markets editor and analyst at the shipping journal Lloyd's List, says that just by waiting to deliver in December rather than November, the difference in profit could be in the order of tens of millions of dollars per shipment.</p><p>While it is possible that buyers elsewhere in the world could snap up the cargoes of some waiting ships, meaning they might leave and head to Asia, for example, it may yet benefit Europe to have a glut of LNG literally floating around.</p><p>Some observers say having the ships wait around is partly a good thing - you want the gas to be available when you need it.</p><p>The only spanner in the works is the sobering sums involved. Feverish demand for gas means that countries have already paid extraordinary amounts to secure it.</p><p>Germany spent 49.5bn euros (£43.25bn) on imports between January and August, according to the Reuters news agency. That's compared to 17.1bn euros during the same period in 2021.</p><p>This is \"market forces\" at work, says Ms Bockmann. But she emphasises that European nations are \"in the best possible position that they could be [in], given the geopolitical situation\".</p><p>Mr Carson agrees, adding: \"In terms of what can actually be done at the moment, the market has responded appropriately.\"</p><p>The real question is what happens next. With gas secured for the coming weeks at least, the price of the commodity in Europe has begun to fall.</p><p>Benchmark gas prices in Europe have fallen dramatically since August, but are still more than twice the price they were this time last year.</p><p>However, further disruptions to supply and very cold winter months could potentially change the picture yet again.</p><p>There's also the global situation to consider. Heightened demand for LNG imports in Europe has boosted competition for gas around the world. Countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh that rely on LNG, but which have less financial leverage in the market, have been stung by the current situation.</p><p>In general, some LNG that might traditionally have gone to Asia has this year sailed to Europe. It has effectively been \"a huge game of musical chairs\", says Mr Halff.</p><p>But some Asian nations, notably China, Japan and South Korea, which also use a lot of LNG, will likely seek significant imports in the colder months, potentially fuelling competition between continents.</p><p>For Corey Grindal, chief operating officer and head of worldwide trading at LNG producer Cheniere, what's happening in the LNG market is \"a very short-term phenomenon\".</p><p>More technology of business:</p><p>Diversification of energy supplies in Europe should ease things in the coming years.</p><p>He adds that the vast majority of his firm's LNG output this year has already been sold and that Cheniere's production should rise from 45 million tonnes to 55 million tonnes by around 2026.</p><p>The current bonanza over gas has concerned some who argue that pivoting to renewables would be better for the planet and possibly more reliable.</p><p>\"Renewable deployments is great. I am [all] for doing the right thing for the planet that we live on,\" says Mr Grindal.</p><p>However, he argues that the need for gas to heat people's homes and generate electricity is immediate. \"We need it today,\" he says.</p><p>What happens tomorrow depends, in varying degrees, on the war in Ukraine, the weather, the rise of renewables, global demand for gas - and hundreds of ships full of LNG sailing either east or west.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Farmers used to test the quality of their soil by burying a pair of underpants in the ground and seeing how quickly they rotted.</p><p>The idea being that the more healthy micro-organisms there are in the ground, such as bacteria and fungi, the faster the fabric would be eaten away.</p><p>Bury the pants now and they may well be dug up the following year in pristine condition.</p><p>That's because, according to experts, more than half of the world's agricultural soil is already degraded.</p><p>In India, soil degradation is one of the factors, alongside debt, that is said to have led to the shocking statistic of nearly 30 people in the farming sector taking their own lives, on average, every day.</p><p>To try to improve matters, a popular Indian guru called Sadhguru is continuing to lead a global campaign called SaveSoil, which pushes to improve soil health around the world. He is calling for farmers to be given incentives, such as financial support, to keep a minimum of 3% of organic content in their soil.</p><p>\"If we take that away and soil becomes sand then it's over,\" he says. \"If we don't attend to our soil problem, we will all be left with desert.\"</p><p>History has shown us the devastating consequences of poor soil.</p><p>\"We all remember those images of the North American dust bowl from the 1930s, and being really shocked by that,\" says David Montgomery, professor of geomorphology at the University of Washington, and the author of three books on soil, including Dirt: The Erosion of Civilizations.</p><p>The reality of most soil degradation is a build-up over time, rather than a single catastrophic event, he adds.</p><p>\"If you are consistently degrading land faster than you're rebuilding its fertility, you're drawing down its batteries, its ability to actually support agricultural production. Fertility is held in the top part of soil, which has literally been stripped off by decades to centuries of agriculture, and it just makes it that much harder to grow food.\"</p><p>There are several causes of soil degradation, from overgrazing, to only growing one crop time after time, and excessive use of weed killers. But one contributing factor is a piece of technology that has revolutionised farming - the plough.</p><p>All around the world, from subsistence small holdings in Africa, to the huge mechanised farms of North Dakota, this very old piece of technology is a quintessential part of farming life.</p><p>Modern ploughing turns the soil in order to get rid of weeds, but in doing so it exposes microbes under the soil that are vital for its wellbeing. These microbes, now exposed to the sun, die and the soil loses its fertility.</p><p>The plough, alongside other machinery such as the combine harvester, has expanded the scale, speed and productivity of farming, leading to more efficient cultivation of more land.</p><p>But Ben Raskin, head of agroforestry and horticulture at the UK's Soil Association, says we need to rethink technology's role in farming.</p><p>\"We have to make sure that technology supports soil and plant health,\" he says.</p><p>That might mean new tools. Farm equipment suppliers such as John Deere are now introducing \"no-till machinery\" - farm equipment that is designed to cause minimum disturbance to the soil.</p><p>These include seed planters that drop seeds into small holes rather than using a big blade to dig a long trench.</p><p>Or it may mean using robots that can help plant and weed in a more gentle way. One such device is the Robotti, made by Danish agricultural tech firm AgroIntelli. The development of this was helped by UK musician-turned-organic farmer Andy Cato, from the band Groove Armada, who tested early versions.</p><p>Meanwhile, cover crops - those that are not harvested, but instead planted to stop the earth being left bare - help to improve soil structure by increasing the organic matter in it.</p><p>Ultimately though, says Mr Raskin, we may need to take the focus away from above-ground solutions and dig a little deeper.</p><p>\"Much of the tech focus in farming has been on the chemical [pesticides] and physical [machinery], but now it is time to start thinking about biology,\" he says.</p><p>Currently it is believed that scientists have identified only around 10% of soil life.</p><p>Prof Montgomery says that for too long \"the whole world that is below ground was kind of invisible to science\". He adds: \"Soil is one of the last big frontiers of science - to understand what is going on in it.\"</p><p>Understanding the make-up of soil could spawn whole new industries, such as biotech that focuses on gene sequencing the microbes in the soil, in an effort to provide farmers with the best nutrients for their land.</p><p>Going back to simple and old-fashioned techniques can also throw up interesting and potentially radical ideas.</p><p>One experiment, conducted as part of the Soil Association's Innovative Farmers programme, used willow woodchip mulch around trees in order to suppress weeds and disease. It was discovered that the acid in it actually stimulated an immune reaction in the trees.</p><p>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.</p><p>And the soil beneath our feet may hold the secrets to some much wider human medicinal breakthroughs.</p><p>Natural products from soil's microbiome are a promising source of medicinal compounds, according to an article in Chemistry World.</p><p>It points out that teixobactin - a toxin that could give rise to the first new class of antibiotics in 30 years - was discovered by sifting through soil samples.</p><p>For farmers worried about the quality of their soil - but unwilling to part with their underpants - there are more modern ways of measuring it.</p><p>Soil samples can be sent off to a laboratory to be tested, although this can be expensive and time-consuming. In the age of data and internet connectivity, smartphones can provide another solution.</p><p>Jack Ingle is the director of Harvest Agri, a UK firm that sells a device called a microbiometer soil test. Farmers take a soil sample, and add it to a test tube with a special solution, which is then transferred to paper.</p><p>With a free app available on both Android and iPhone, the sample can be scanned to reveal a number that designates how many fungal and bacterial microbes are present.</p><p>And it is not just farmers who are measuring the quality of the soil.</p><p>A group of scientists have created a database of soil health measurements from sites across the globe called SoilHealthDB. And last year the EU established the EU Soil Observatory to collect and track soil data, and to support soil research and policy development.</p><p>But much of the future of farming technology could be about learning from the past, thinks Prof Montgomery.</p><p>\"It's taking some of the ancient wisdom, like crop rotation and cover crops, and to merge that in new ways with modern technology - the sensors, the robots and the prospecting for microbial inoculants [beneficial micro-organisms],\" he says.</p>",

They also asked the official to secretly record trial strategy meetings.</p><p>While the company was not named in the documents or by Attorney General Merrick Garland at a news conference on Monday, US media has reported it to be China-headquartered tech giant Huawei, citing sources familiar with the investigation. US officials declined to identify the company.</p><p>\"This was an egregious attempt by PRC (People's Republic of China) intelligence officers to shield a PRC based company from accountability and to undermine the integrity of our judicial system,\" Mr Garland said,</p><p>The two alleged spies paid the official tens of thousands of dollars in cash and jewellery, including $41,000 in Bitcoin for a photograph of a single page - marked \"classified\" - that purported to discuss a plan to charge and arrest company officials. Additional payments were made as recently as last week.</p><p>Unknown to the alleged spies, the US official was working on behalf of the FBI and passed along fake documents, Mr Garland told reporters.</p><p>In a separate case in New Jersey, four people - including three alleged intelligence operatives - were charged with using a fake think tank to recruit current and former US officials. According to Mr Garland, the suspects hoped to procure technology and have it shipped to China, as well as interfere with US protests that could be \"embarrassing\".</p><p>Additionally, seven Chinese nationals were charged with attempting to force a naturalised US citizen to return to China, part of what US officials described as part of a transnational effort to recover fugitives and silence dissidents and perceived opponents of the Chinese government. Two of those suspects are in custody.</p><p>According to Mr Garland, the Chinese government forced the victim's nephew to travel from China to convey threats, told him that \"coming back and turning herself in is the only way out\", and sent agents to the home of the victim's son.</p><p>\"They made clear that their harassment would not stop until the victim returned to China,\" Mr Garland said.</p><p>Prosecutors had filed similar charges against alleged Chinese spies last year, accusing them of attempting to exert influence over US citizens and residents.</p><p>In late 2021 and early 2022, for example, US officials believe an affiliate of China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) hired a US-based private investigator to uncover \"unflattering information\" about a US congressional candidate who had participated in pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong in 2015, as well as at least one state-level legislator who they believed may run for re-election.</p><p>Wang Wenbin, spokesperson for China's foreign ministry, said he wasn't aware of the specific circumstances of the cases but did say that US law enforcement \"repeatedly fabricates lies to smear China, irrationally suppress Chinese business and obstruct China's efforts to chase down fugitives\". He said the aim was to \"turn the US into a safe haven for the corrupt and for lawbreakers\".</p><p>He added: \"What the US side has done stands in opposition to the issue and the rule of law, undermining the foundation of US-China law enforcement co-operation as well as damaging the US side's own image..\"</p>",

I've made a film that's helping rape culture'.\"</p><p>She says she has seen other videos on TikTok that have been swamped with abusive comments where the creator is appealing for likes and positivity to help \"pull them back from the wrong side of TikTok\".</p><p>Ms Hartley's original video, Keep Breathing, was 18 minutes long and made in 2018, with funding from various local organisations in Derby and backed by the British Film Institute.</p><p>It is a fictional story featuring a couple arguing in a lift about a previous sexual encounter, interwoven with flashbacks to the evening it took place.</p><p>The characters had both been drinking alcohol, they met in a nightclub, and there were misunderstandings about how they were going to get home and whether the man was going to stay with the woman.</p><p>However, the clip she posted to TikTok in September featured only the pair's argument and not the contextual flashbacks. When Ms Hartley tried to add a separate video featuring those, they were repeatedly removed by TikTok on the grounds that they were explicit.</p><p>She has now been able to share the context, but says there are still many comments which are abusive towards women.</p><p>Although she considered removing the videos, Ms Hartley says she is content that she decided to share the post.</p><p>\"I don't regret it, but I'm trying to navigate how to respond,\" she said.</p><p>\"Some of the comments have been healthy, a couple of people have changed their minds while replying to each other. I think it's important, it needs to go out there.\"</p><p>Social media consultant Matt Navarra said that TikTok's algorithm functions as a recommendation service, drawing both on the previous activity of the individual user and others like them, in order to serve up new content with which the person is also likely to engage.</p><p>This keeps them on the platform for longer and more frequently, which is good for advertisers and therefore also good for TikTok's advertising revenue.</p><p>\"It means if this content has been seen, engaged with and liked by a group of users who are, for example, Andrew Tate fans, then it's likely to show that piece of content to even more people who are that sort of user,\" he said. \"It's self perpetuating.\"</p><p>The creator cannot stop this train once it is in motion, because they have no control over the algorithm itself and there are limited options for reporting issues, Mr Navarra added.</p><p>In July it was reported that Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, was going to make its algorithm more similar to TikTok's, rather than prioritising content from accounts that individuals were already following.</p>",

Some months ago, that stood at 20%, and it has since come down to 15% this month.</p><p>At a time of acute labour shortages, employers are having to work harder to recruit, enthuse and retain staff. That even includes Microsoft itself, according to Mr Nadella.</p><p>\"We had 70,000 people who joined Microsoft during the pandemic, they sort of saw Microsoft through the lens of the pandemic. And now when we think about the next phase, you need to re-energize them, re-recruit them, help them form social connections.\"</p><p>Microsoft employees can work from home up to 50% of the time as standard. More than that requires management approval or a move to part-time working.</p><p>Some companies have struggled to impose new working arrangements and expectations.</p><p>There has been resistance to calls at Apple to return to the office three days a week from September, while Tesla boss Elon Musk has demanded 40 hours a week in the office sending an email saying: \"If you don't show up, we will assume you have resigned.\"</p><p>An unprecedented number of people have also changed jobs since the start of the pandemic. A phenomenon Microsoft has dubbed \"the great reshuffle\", sees workers born after 1997 (so-called Generation Z) nearly twice as likely to switch jobs.</p><p>\"At the peak of our 'great reshuffle' we saw a year-on-year increase of 50% of LinkedIn members changing jobs. Gen Z was at 90%,\" the report said.</p><p>By 2030, Generation Z will make up about 30% of the entire workforce so managers need to understand them, according to LinkedIn's boss.</p><p>As you might expect, alongside its new observations Microsoft has new products aimed at easing this potential mismatch in expectations. It is focusing on helping companies' younger workers feel a sense of belonging to, and an ability to learn in, an organisation in the way staff did in the past.</p><p>Its new Viva software, for example, allows direct contact to senior managers, online teaching and a channel to share personal photos - somewhat like a company intranet site with bells on to ring in a new world of work, which employers in particular are struggling to navigate.</p>",

In a tweet, he thanked all three for their \"collective contribution to Twitter\", calling them \"massive talents\" and \"beautiful humans\".</p><p>Meanwhile, Bret Taylor - who had served as Twitter's chairman since last November - updated his LinkedIn profile to indicate that he was no longer in the post.</p><p>Mr Musk, a self-styled \"free speech absolutist\", has been critical of Twitter's management and its moderation policies.</p><p>They clashed over the terms of the takeover, with Mr Musk accusing Twitter of providing misleading information about the firm's user numbers.</p><p>He has also said he would reverse bans on suspended users, which could include former US President Donald Trump, who was excluded following the Capitol riot in January 2021.</p><p>At the time, Twitter said there was a risk Mr Trump would incite further violence. But Mr Musk has described the ban as \"foolish\".</p><p>Earlier this week, Mr Musk said that he doesn't want the platform to become an echo chamber for hate and division. \"Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hell-scape, where anything can be said with no consequences!\" he tweeted.</p><p>The takeover has prompted discussion among Twitter users over what the platform will look like under Mr Musk's ownership.</p><p>There are fears that more lenient free speech policies would mean people banned for hate speech or disinformation may be invited back to the platform. As well as Mr Trump, that could include political extremists, QAnon loyalists and Covid-19 deniers.</p><p>In response to Mr Musk's missive, Thierry Breton the EU commissioner for the internal market tweeted \"In Europe, the bird will fly by our EU rules\" suggesting regulators will take a tough stance against any relaxation of Twitter's policies.</p><p>Mr Musk as well as being the world's richest person with $250bn to his name, is a controversial figure.</p><p>He made his fortune through the electric car company Tesla, and space exploration firm Space X. But he has drawn additional attention by his outspoken intervention in unrelated matters, often using Twitter as the platform, ranging from geopolitical issues such as the war in Ukraine to the rescue of the schoolboys trapped in a Thai cave.</p><p>It is not clear yet whether the clear out of senior management is the forerunner to company-wide job cuts. Earlier reports suggested 75% of staff at the social media company were set to lose their jobs but those reports were \"inaccurate\", according to Ross Gerber, a shareholder in both Twitter and Mr Musk's other company Tesla.</p><p>\"There are a lot of talented people at Twitter, especially on the engineering side and they want to retain as much of that talent as possible,\" Mr Gerber told the BBC.</p><p>But he said the job losses could nevertheless extend far beyond upper management. Mr Musk might look to cut product managers and end projects \"that aren't going anywhere\" he said.</p><p>Until recently it appeared the deal could still fall through.</p><p>After building a stake in Twitter at the start of the year, Mr Musk made his $44bn offer in April, a price tag that looked too high almost as soon as it was agreed.</p><p>He said he was buying it because he wanted \"civilisation to have a common digital town square\" and said he planned to clean up spam accounts and preserve the platform as a venue for free speech.</p><p>But by the summer he had changed his mind about the purchase, citing concerns that the number of fake accounts on the platform was higher than Twitter claimed.</p><p>The Elon Musk Show</p><p>From South Africa to Silicon Valley - the enigmatic, compelling and controversial inside story of the world's richest man, as told by family, friends and enemies.</p><p>Watch Now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)</p><p>Eventually Twitter executives took legal action to hold Mr Musk to his offer and while he recently admitted he and the other investors involved in the deal were \"overpaying for Twitter right now\", the deal does now appear to have gone through.</p><p>But speculation continues around Mr Musk's intentions for the platform.</p><p>Earlier this week, he changed his Twitter profile to read \"Chief Twit\" and some observers believe he will take the reins at the firm himself.</p><p>Mr Musk also tweeted a video of himself walking into Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco carrying a sink with the caption: \"let that sink in!\"</p><p>There has been no comment yet from Twitter about its new management team. But whoever becomes its next chief executive, it is clear that Mr Musk will ultimately be in charge of the company - a role he will have to balance with his management positions at both Tesla and SpaceX.</p><p>He sat briefly on Twitter's board earlier this year, and criticised the firm's strategy.</p><p>In private messages revealed in court filings, Mr Musk talked about how Mr Agrawal didn't understand how to fix the social media platform's problems.</p><p>Mr Musk has also posted that his plans for Twitter include more ambitious changes including \"X, the app for everything\".</p><p>Some suggest this might be something along the lines of the hugely successful Chinese app WeChat, a kind of \"super app\" that incorporates different services including messaging, social media, payments and food orders.</p><p>Additional reporting by Lucy Hooker and Chris Vallance</p>",

The sensors and transducers within the dummy provide potentially lifesaving data, measuring the precise physical forces exerted on each body part in a crash event.</p><p>The team record data including velocity of impact, crushing force, bending, torque of the body and braking rates.</p><p>They are focused on seeing what happens to the biomechanics of the dummy during low-impact rear collisions.</p><p>When a woman is in a car crash she is up to three times more likely to suffer whiplash injuries in rear impacts in comparison with a man, according to US government data. Although whiplash is not usually fatal, it can lead to physical disabilities - some of which can be permanent.</p><p>It is these statistics that drive Astrid Linder, the director of traffic safety at the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute, who is leading the research in Linköping.</p><p>\"We know from injury statistics that if we look at low severity impacts females are at higher risk.</p><p>\"So, in order to ensure that you identify the seats that have the best protection for both parts of the population, we definitely need to have the part of the population at highest risk represented,\" she told the BBC.</p><p>Dr Linder believes her research can help shape the way cars are specified in the future and she stresses the key differences between men and women. Females are shorter and lighter than males, on average, and they have different muscle strengths.</p><p>Because of this they physically respond differently in a car crash.</p><p>\"We have differences in the shape of the torso and the centre of gravity and the outline of our hips and pelvis,\" she explained.</p><p>But Dr Linder will still need regulators to enforce the use of the average female she has developed.</p><p>Currently there is no legal requirement for car safety tests for rear impact collisions to be carried out on anything other than the average man.</p><p>Although some car companies are already using them in their own safety tests they are not yet used in EU or US regulatory tests.</p><p>Engineers are starting to create more diverse dummies, including dummies that represent babies, elderly and overweight people.</p><p>The average female dummy in Linköping has a fully flexible spine, which means the team can look at what happens to the whole spine, from the head to the lower back, when a woman is injured.</p><p>US company Humanetics is the largest manufacturer of crash test dummies worldwide and is seen as the leading voice when it comes to the precision of the technology.</p><p>CEO Christopher O'Connor told the BBC he believes that safety has \"advanced significantly over the last 20, 30, 40 years\" but it \"really hasn't taken into account the differences between a male and a female\".</p><p>\"You can't have the same device to test a man and a woman. We're not going to crack the injuries we are seeing today unless we put sensors there to measure those injuries.</p><p>\"By measuring those injuries we can then have safer cars with safer airbags, with safer seatbelts, with safer occupant compartments that allow for different sizes.\"</p><p>The UN is examining its regulations on crash testing and will determine whether they need to be changed to better protect all drivers.</p><p>If changes are made to involve a crash test dummy representing the average female, there is an expectation that women will one day be safer behind the wheel.</p><p>\"My hope for the future is that the safety of vehicles will be assessed for both parts of the population,\" Dr Linder said.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I am peering through a jeweller's eyeglass, looking for the BBC logo that has been inscribed inside a small diamond.</p><p>The inscription has been made using unique technology developed by Oxford-based Opsydia.</p><p>Its machines are the only ones on the market that can penetrate the surface of a diamond and manipulate its atoms.</p><p>The logo I am trying to find is less than half a millimetre wide. Despite instruction from Lewis Fish, head of product at Opsydia, I can't see it.</p><p>\"It is very difficult,\" he says. \"They're intentionally very fine, and it is really trained jewellers they are aimed at.\"</p><p>But why would anyone want to write on the inside of a diamond?</p><p>\"The big thing that's happening in the industry is traceability and transparency,\" says Andrew Rimmer, the chief executive of Opsydia.</p><p>He believes that Opsydia's technology can improve on the existing ways that diamonds are identified.</p><p>There are already systems for tracking a diamond, from when it first emerges from a mine as a rough diamond, through the cutting and polishing phase and on to the retailer.</p><p>But the process is far from perfect. Last year, Human Rights Watch (HRW) criticised jewellers, saying many could not identify the mines of origin for their diamonds.</p><p>That is important, according to HRW, because \"labour rights violations, violence, and other abuses have remained a serious problem in gold and diamond mining\".</p><p>More technology of business:</p><p>It is also becoming crucial for diamond sellers to be able to distinguish between those that have come from mines, known as natural diamonds, and the growing number of diamonds produced by machines, known as lab-grown diamonds.</p><p>The technology for producing lab-grown diamonds is improving all the time, and they are a fast-growing section of the market.</p><p>But natural diamonds are considerably more expensive than lab-grown gems, so it is important to have a reliable way of telling them apart.</p><p>Mr Rimmer explains that his systems can provide that failsafe verification, by inscribing data inside the diamond - data that is impossible to remove, but does not devalue the gem in any way.</p><p>\"People who are making diamond jewellery, they want to be able to show to the consumer this is a natural diamond and from an ethical source,\" says Mr Rimmer.</p><p>Opsydia's diamond-inscribing machine is the size of a very large photocopier. Inside is a pulsed laser that emits very short laser bursts.</p><p>Such high-powered bursts can accurately manipulate materials like diamonds and other gems at very small scales.</p><p>However, just pointing the laser at a diamond is not enough - the diamond's structure would scatter the beam.</p><p>\"Diamond is about the most difficult material out of the transparent materials to process with lasers,\" says Mr Rimmer.</p><p>Opsydia's system tunes the laser so that it can pass through the surface of the diamond, usually to a depth of about a quarter of a millimetre.</p><p>Instead of randomly bouncing around the diamond, the laser comes to a pinpoint focus to create the inscription to suit the client's need.</p><p>If the diamond needs an identification number which is invisible to anyone without powerful microscopes, then the system can alter the diamond at the molecular level.</p><p>However, if a jeweller wants its logo to be visible then the laser can be used to make bigger changes to the carbon structure of the diamond.</p><p>At the moment Opsydia can assemble only a small number of the £400,000 ($480,000) machines at a time. But it is expanding its operation and expects soon to be selling dozens of the machines a year.</p><p>Mr Rimmer is optimistic that the laser technology will have other applications too.</p><p>The laser can make atomic-scale changes to create circuitry inside the diamond. That could be useful for making instruments for radiation detection, where a diamond's durability is also an asset.</p><p>Potentially such circuitry could also be used in quantum computers - machines that can perform complex calculations in a fraction of the time taken by existing devices.</p><p>Quantum computers work by exploiting the weird quantum properties of individual particles. They are hard to build and are still in their early stages, but diamonds offer a promising way to isolate and use the quantum properties of nitrogen atoms.</p><p>More technology of business:</p><p>But for now, Opsydia is focused on the diamond verification business, and that is a good place to be, according to Edahn Golan, an Israel-based consultant to the diamond industry.</p><p>\"There's a growing movement to track diamonds in an impartial way,\" he says.</p><p>\"At this point, none of the systems are perfect, because nothing is implemented fully from the mine to the store.\"</p><p>The digital ledger technology, blockchain, will become more widespread in the jewellery industry, according to Mr Golan.</p><p>He says the verification methods are going to evolve as miners are keen to distinguish their diamonds from those made in factories and consumers want to know their jewellery is ethically sourced.</p><p>\"If I walk into your jewellery store on Main Street USA and ask: 'Can you guarantee that this particular diamond that you're offering me is ethical?' - and you blink - you have a problem,\" he says.</p>",

Job done, as far as he is concerned.</p><p>There has been no official confirmation as yet, and the silence from Twitter HQ so far has been rather deafening.</p><p>But perhaps there is nobody there to send that email - Mr Musk has reportedly already fired chief executive Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, and legal and policy executive Vijaya Gadde, while chairman Bret Taylor's LinkedIn profile suggests he is no longer at the firm either.</p><p>So what might Mr Musk's Twitter look like?</p><p>Mr Musk addressed potential advertisers in an uncharacteristically humble message posted on the site on Thursday. In it, he spoke of buying Twitter because he wanted to \"try to help humanity\", and said he wanted \"civilisation to have a digital town square\". He also accepted that his mission may fail.</p><p>The fact that he wrote specifically to those who advertise on Twitter suggests he intends for now at least to stick with its digital advertising business model. That is despite this revenue starting to fall for giants like Google-owner Alphabet and Facebook-owner Meta, as the global economic slowdown bites and firms find themselves with less cash to splash on marketing</p><p>In the past he has spoken bombastically about wanting to lighten moderation, so that more voices can be heard more freely (Twitter has long been accused of favouring left-leaning, liberal messages, which it denies).</p><p>Might he decide to bring back some of the more controversial tweeters, banned under the previous administration - former US president Donald Trump (who has previously said he had no desire to return), or more recently, his friend Kanye West?</p><p>I am not so sure. Mr Musk now offers a more curtailed vision, saying that the platform must remain \"welcoming\", must abide by national laws and must not become \"a free-for-all hellscape\".</p><p>West was banned for anti-Semitism and Mr Trump \"permanently suspended\" for inciting violence - sounds a bit hellscapey to me.</p><p>Mr Musk has raged against the amount of spam and bot accounts he believes litter the site - Twitter has always disputed his claims that its official figure is far too low. He could order a mass cull, although that would probably affect everybody's all-important follower numbers, which could be an unpopular first move.</p><p>Perhaps his most intriguing hint so far is about his new company being the start of \"X, the everything app\". He has never elaborated on that but many have suggested that he is referring to the creation of a kind of \"super app\" along the lines of China's WeChat - a one-stop-shop for social media, messaging, finance, food orders - in a nutshell, everyday life admin.</p><p>The West does not yet have such a thing, although one could argue that Meta's WhatsApp and even Facebook Messenger are quietly morphing into services with multiple functions.</p><p>Mr Musk has not disguised his love of cryptocurrency and Binance, the world's largest crypto-exchange, is a proud investor in his vision (according to the press release I received just after 05:00 BST).</p><p>Could we see a Twitter set-up for businesses to accept payments - in crypto? That would be a hit with crypto fans and a horror for those who warn that crypto remains a risky choice, unregulated and therefore unprotected if anything goes wrong.</p><p>What we do know about Mr Musk is that he is visionary, volatile, ambitious, and creative. We can guarantee the changes will start rolling in - and already some Twitter fans are saying the change of leadership will drive them away.</p><p>\"We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters,\" said the investor Peter Thiel of the tech industry, long before the meme \"expectations vs reality\" became a thing. With Mr Musk, we may well get both.</p><p>Follow Zoe Kleinman on Twitter (of course) @zsk</p>",

        "content": "<p>Russia failed to take down Ukrainian computer systems with a massive cyber-attack when it invaded this year, despite many analysts' predictions. The work of a little-known arm of the US military which hunts for adversaries online may be one reason. The BBC was given exclusive access to the cyber-operators involved in these global missions.</p><p>In early December last year, a small US military team led by a young major arrived in Ukraine on a reconnaissance trip ahead of a larger deployment. But the major quickly reported that she needed to stay.</p><p>\"Within a week we had the whole team there ready to go hunting,\" one of the team recalls.</p><p>They had come to detect Russians online and their Ukrainian partners made it clear they needed to start work straight away.</p><p>\"She looked at the situation and told me the team wouldn't leave,\" Maj Gen William J Hartman, who heads the US Cyber National Mission Force, told the BBC.</p><p>\"We almost immediately got the feedback that 'it's different in Ukraine right now'. We didn't redeploy the team, we reinforced the team.\"</p><p>Since 2014, Ukraine has witnessed some of the world's most significant cyber-attacks, including the first in which a power station was switched off remotely in the dead of winter.</p><p>By late last year, Western intelligence officials were watching Russian military preparations and growing increasingly concerned that a new blizzard of cyber-attacks would accompany an invasion, crippling communications, power, banking and government services, to pave the way for the seizure of power.</p><p>The US military Cyber Command wanted to discover whether Russian hackers had already infiltrated Ukrainian systems, hiding deep inside. Within two weeks, their mission became one of its largest deployments with around 40 personnel from across US armed services.</p><p>In January they had a front-row seat as Russia began paving the way in cyberspace for a coming invasion in which Ukraine's cyber-defences would be put to an unprecedented test.</p><p>The infiltration of computer networks had for many years been primarily about espionage - stealing secrets - but recently has been increasingly militarised and linked to more destructive activities like sabotage or preparation for war.</p><p>This means a new role for the US military, whose teams are engaged in \"Hunt Forward\" missions, scouring the computer networks of partner countries for signs of penetration.</p><p>\"They are hunters and they know the behaviour of their 'prey',\" explains the operator who leads defensive work against Russia.</p><p>The US military asked for some operators to remain anonymous and others to be identified only by their first names due to security concerns.</p><p>Since 2018, US military operators have been deployed to 20 countries, usually close allies, in Europe, the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific region. - although not countries like the UK, Germany or France, which have their own expertise and are less likely to need or want outside help.</p><p>Most of their work has been battling state-hackers from China and North Korea but Russia has been their most persistent adversary. Some countries have seen multiple deployments, including Ukraine, where for the first time cyber attacks were combined with a full-scale war.</p><p>Inviting the US military into your country can be sensitive and even controversial domestically, so many partners ask that the US presence remains secret - the teams rarely wear uniform. But increasingly, governments are choosing to make missions public.</p><p>In May, Lithuania confirmed a three-month deployment had just finished working on its defence and foreign affairs networks, prioritised because of concerns over threats from Russia in the wake of the Ukraine invasion.</p><p>Croatia hosted the most recent deployment. \"The hunt was thorough and successful, and we discovered and prevented malicious attacks on Croatian state infrastructure,\" Daniel Markić, the head of the country's security and intelligence agency, says.</p><p>\"We were able to offer the US a new 'hunting ground' for malicious actors and share our experience and acquired knowledge,\" he adds.</p><p>But warm public statements mask the reality that these missions often begin uneasily.</p><p>Even countries allied to the US can be nervous about allowing the US to root around inside sensitive government networks. In fact, revelations from former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden 10 years ago suggested that the US spied on friends as well as enemies.</p><p>That suspicion means the young men and women arriving on a mission are often faced with a stern test of their diplomatic skills. They show up at an airport hauling dozens of boxes of mysterious technical equipment and need to quickly build trust to get permission to do something sensitive - install that equipment on the host country's government computer networks to scan for threats.</p><p>\"That is a pretty scary proposition if you're a host nation,\" explains Gen Hartman. \"You immediately have some concern that we're going to go do something nefarious or it's some super-secret kind of backdoor operation.\"</p><p>Put simply, the Americans need to convince their hosts they are there to help them - and not to spy on them.</p><p>\"I'm not interested in your emails,\" is how Mark, who led two teams in the Indo-Pacific region, describes his opening gambit. If a demonstration goes well they can get down to work.</p><p>Local partners sometimes sit with US teams around in conference rooms observing closely to make sure nothing untoward is going on. \"We have to make sure we convey that trust,\" says Eric, a 20-year veteran of cyber operations. \"Having people sit side-saddle with us is a big factor in developing that.\"</p><p>And although suspicion can never be totally dispelled, a common adversary binds them together.</p><p>\"The one thing that these partners want is the Russians out of their networks,\" Gen Hartman recalls one of his team telling him.</p><p>US Cyber Command offers an insight into what the Russians, or others, are up to, particularly since it works closely with the National Security Agency, America's largest intelligence agency which monitors communications and cyberspace.</p><p>In one case, proof of infiltration came in real-time. One US operator, Chris, who has led multiple European missions, recalls observing someone move suspiciously around the computer network of a partner country.</p><p>What was bizarre was that it appeared to be one of the local network administrators the team was working with. That person was standing right behind Chris. Could it be some kind of insider threat?</p><p>\"Is that you?\" Chris asked.</p><p>\"That is my computer, but I swear that's not me,\" the administrator responded, transfixed as if watching a movie. Someone had stolen his online identity.</p><p>\"Finding someone on your network is not a good moment especially when they are using your credentials,\" Chris recalls. That moment conveyed the reality of the threat and in turn helped secure more access.</p><p>The US teams say they share what they find to allow the local partner to eject Russians (or other state hackers) rather than do it themselves. They also use commercial tools so that local partners can continue after the mission is over.</p><p>A good relationship can pay dividends. At the end of one mission, US operators say that local partners handed them a parting gift - a computer disc containing malicious software, or malware, from another network the team had not been inside.</p><p>Each mission is different and there are some where an adversary has been found on the very first day of looking, explains Shannon who has led two missions in Europe. But it often takes a week or two to unearth more advanced hackers who have burrowed deeper.</p><p>A cat-and-mouse game is often played with hackers from Russian intelligence agencies who are particularly adept at changing tactics.</p><p>In 2021, it emerged the Russians had used software from a company called SolarWinds to infiltrate the networks of the customers who bought it, including governments.</p><p>US operators began looking for traces of their presence. A tech sergeant in Cyber Command who liked puzzles spotted the way the Russians were hiding their code in one European country, General Hartman says. Unscrambling it, he was able to establish the Russians were hiding on a network. Eight different samples of malicious software, all attributed to Russian intelligence, were then made public to allow industry to improve defences.</p><p>Hunting is not an altruistic act by the US military. As well as providing hands-on experience for its teams, it can also help at home. In one mission, a young enlisted cyber operator found the same malware they had discovered in a European country was also present on a US government agency. The US has often struggled to identify and root out vulnerabilities domestically, whether in industry or government, because of overlapping responsibilities between different agencies even as it sends out its operators abroad.</p><p>Hunt Forward missions are classed as \"defensive\" but Gen Paul Nakasone, who leads both the military's Cyber Command and the National Security Agency confirmed offensive missions have also been undertaken against Russia in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. But he and others declined to provide further detail.</p><p>This January, the team in Ukraine were trying to avoid slipping on icy pavements when a series of major cyber-attacks hit. \"Be afraid and expect the worst,\" read a message posted by hackers on the Foreign Ministry website.</p><p>The US team watched in real-time as a wave of so-called wiper software, which renders computers unusable, hit multiple government websites.</p><p>\"They were able to assist in analysing some of the ongoing attacks, and facilitate that information being shared back to partners in the United States,\" Gen Hartman says.</p><p>The aim was to destabilise the country ahead of the February invasion.</p><p>By the time Russian troops flooded over the border, the US team had been pulled out. Knowledge of the physical risk for their Ukrainian partners who remained weighed heavily on them.</p><p>Hours before the invasion began on 24 February, a cyber-attack crippled a US satellite communications provider that supported the Ukrainian military. Many predicted this would be the start of a wave of attacks to take down key areas like railways. But that did not happen.</p><p>\"One of the reasons the Russians may not have been so successful is that the Ukrainians were better prepared,\" says Gen Hartman.</p><p>\"There's a lot of pride in the way they were able to defend. A lot of the world thought they would just be run over. And they weren't,\" says Al, a senior technical analyst who was part of the Ukrainian deployment team. \"They resisted.\"</p><p>Ukraine has been subject to continued cyber-attacks which, if successful, could have affected infrastructure. But the country has continued to defend itself better than many expected. Ukrainian officials have said that this has been in part thanks to help from allies, including US Cyber Command and the private sector as well as their own growing experience. Now, the US and other allies are turning to the Ukrainians to learn from them.</p><p>\"We continue to share information with the Ukrainians, they continue to share information with us,\" explains Gen Hartman. \"That's really the whole idea of that enduring partnership.\"</p><p>With Ukrainian and Western intelligence officials expressing concerns that Moscow may respond to recent military setbacks by escalating its cyber-attacks, it is a partnership that may still face further tests.</p>",

For Mr Trump it was his way of connecting directly with voters, bypassing the traditional media.</p><p>Ironically, it was also a way of getting attention from the media he claimed to shun. \"He's tweeted\" was a regular refrain across the world's newsrooms.</p><p>But times have changed. There are now several reasons why Mr Trump may not come running back to Twitter.</p><p>Firstly he now owns and runs his own social media company, known as \"Truth Social\".</p><p>It looks almost exactly like Twitter - and allows people to post \"Truths\". It's owned by Mr Trump - so he has a direct financial interest in the success of the company.</p><p>And by far the biggest asset that Truth Social has is Donald Trump.</p><p>Donald Trump won't get paid a cent for tweeting on Twitter. He could benefit hugely if Truth Social becomes a major social media platform though.</p><p>At the moment - Truth Social is not that.</p><p>According to the app analysis company Sensor Tower, Truth Social had just 92,000 installs last month.</p><p>To put that into context, Sensor Tower estimates that Twitter was installed more than 14 million times over that period.</p><p>It's anaemic, miniscule growth for a social media company.</p><p>But if Truth Social does have a shot at being relevant, Mr Trump needs to be on there - and exclusively so.</p><p>It helps to explain why, in a statement from Mr Trump, he didn't say he was thinking about coming back on to Twitter.</p><p>Money isn't the only consideration for Mr Trump and his advisers though.</p><p>There is also a school of thought that Trump off Twitter is better for his polling.</p><p>The theory goes that Twitter served Mr Trump well when he was establishing himself.</p><p>But now, does he really need Twitter?</p><p>And some Republicans believe the public can have \"too much Trump\", that wild statements and claims that catch people's attention can distract from Republican talking points.</p><p>And even if Mr Trump wanted to come back, it seems it's now possible that the door won't be opened for him.</p><p>In a tweet on Friday, Elon Musk said a council would decide whether banned people could return.</p><p>This sounds a lot like the Facebook Oversight Board, that made a decision that Mr Trump should be banned from Facebook for two years (they will need to make a decision on whether he can return in January).</p><p>It's possible they will conclude Mr Trump's ban should remain.</p><p>Mr Trump and Mr Musk are both brilliant users of Twitter. But they are also hard to predict. For all we know, Donald Trump will be happily tweeting away in no time.</p><p>But there are plenty of reasons to believe that he won't be back using his favourite megaphone any time soon.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Going for a job interview is the stuff of nightmares for many people, while for others it is a chance to shine.</p><p>Either way you are typically still interviewed by other human beings, either after walking into a scary office with one or more bosses sitting behind a desk, or via an equally nerve-wracking Zoom call.</p><p>Yet thanks to advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) technology, you may soon be interviewed for that job you really want... by a computer.</p><p>Earlier this year students at Sandwell College in West Bromwich put on VR headsets to do some mock interviews.</p><p>Their avatars - cartoon-like, 3D representations of themselves - were put through their paces by another talking avatar representing the AI software system.</p><p>\"I'd never had an interview before in my life,\" says engineering student Ayyan Ahmed. \"But because there was no human judging me, and it was all online, I could actually express myself.</p><p>\"And then, at the end of the process, he [the VR interviewer] told me what I did wrong, and what I did right. It really helped me to know what to do in my next interview.\"</p><p>The VR system the students were using is made by London-based company Bodyswaps.</p><p>Questions and requests that the interviewees get asked range from the straightforward \"tell me about your greatest achievements\", to the more challenging \"do you prefer to be loved or feared?\"</p><p>The user then gets feedback, not just on what they said, but how they say it, whether they are maintaining eye contact with the interviewer avatar, and even their posture.</p><p>Bodyswaps' chief executive Christophe Mallet says the idea is that people can keep practising with the simulated job interviews until they feel ready for a real-life one.</p><p>He believes that the technology has the chance to level the playing field for candidates from less well-off backgrounds who might not otherwise have the opportunity to practise for job interviews in a professional setting.</p><p>\"Things like communication, empathy and leadership are the secrets to success [in interviews], but how can you practise those? If you are rich, you can get a coach. Otherwise you have e-learning [such as watching videos on the topic], but that doesn't work as you are lacking immersion.</p><p>\"Using VR and AI we now have a way to immerse you safely in a simulation where you can practise interview conversations.\"</p><p>Bodyswaps launched its interview simulations last year, and says it is mainly targeting schools, colleges and universities, so their students can practise before they enter the jobs market. Its business model is subscription based, with the amount an institution has to pay each year being dependent on how many people use the system.</p><p>While Bodyswaps is currently focused on mock job interrogations, the AI technology of Swedish firm Tengai is already allowing firms out in the real world to get a computer to do their initial job interviews.</p><p>The AI software is represented as a talking cartoon head that appears on the screen of a candidate's computer or smartphone. It asks a set list of questions, and then the recorded answers are used to help recruiters draw up shortlists for jobs.</p><p>Tengai's chief executive Elin Öberg Mårtenzon says that a central aim of the software is to avoid making wrong assumptions, such as judging someone on their appearance.</p><p>\"We wanted to create a situation where you could actually look at objective data instead, by putting some sort of filter between the candidate and the recruiter,\" she says.</p><p>\"And that filter is supposed to mitigate bias in the process… so that they know that they are not being judged by things other than those relating to the job description.\"</p><p>But while it might be tempting to see AI and VR technology as the magical solution for selecting the right candidate for a job, employment lawyer Susan Thompson says we need to be cautious.</p><p>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.</p><p>\"AI doesn't eliminate risk, and it's not without risk itself,\" says the partner at London law firm Simkins. \"So I think that's the most important thing employers need to be mindful of.</p><p>\"We have to remember, AI is actually still fundamentally created by a human. [So], first and foremost, I'd be saying to any employer who's thinking of using it, be it at the interview stage, or even at the exit stage, 'do you understand it, and to what extent have you spoken to the developer about what data points it uses?'</p><p>\"And, has it been stress tested to eliminate bias? Does it eliminate gender bias? And how does it do that?\"</p><p>Ms Thompson adds: \"I would be hesitant in advocating that AI is used exclusively in the interview process. I think there should be some sort of human intervention somewhere.\"</p>",

        "content": "<p>It was a cool evening in late March in San Jose.</p><p>A hastily organised meeting had been arranged at an Airbnb to host the world's richest person.</p><p>The meeting was a big one for Twitter. Elon Musk had recently become Twitter's largest shareholder. Now there was talk that he wanted to join the company's board.</p><p>When Twitter's chairman, Bret Taylor, arrived at the venue it was not quite what he was expecting.</p><p>This \"wins for the weirdest place I've had a meeting recently\", he reportedly texted Mr Musk.</p><p>\"I think they were looking for an Airbnb near the airport and there are tractors and donkeys,\" he told him.</p><p>However, the meeting went swimmingly.</p><p>A few days later it was announced that Mr Musk was to join Twitter's board.</p><p>That was only the beginning. The next six months would witness one of the most crazy, on-off deals in Silicon Valley's history.</p><p>At the beginning of April, Mr Musk seemed happy with his board position at Twitter, tweeting regularly about how the company might change.</p><p>However, private meetings between him and Twitter's CEO Parag Agrawal had not gone well. The two did not see eye to eye on how to fix the platform. Mr Musk got frustrated.</p><p>\"Fixing Twitter by chatting with Parag won't work,\" he is said to have texted Mr Taylor. \"Drastic action is needed.\"</p><p>On 14 April, the billionaire publicly stated that he wanted to buy Twitter - lock, stock and barrel.</p><p>He offered $44bn (£38bn) for Twitter in a take it or leave it offer. Twitter's board initially rejected the offer, even creating a \"poison pill\" provision to try to prevent Mr Musk from forcibly buying the company.</p><p>Then another change of heart (not the first in this story). Twitter's board decided that, on reflection, they would take the deal and on 25 April, Twitter announced they had accepted the offer.</p><p>\"Yesssss\" Mr Musk tweeted.</p><p>Mr Musk argued that Twitter had lost its way. He said Twitter had too often restricted speech and, as the world's \"town hall\", it needed to place free speech above all else.</p><p>He said he did not care about the \"economics at all\" in an interview at the TED2022 conference in Vancouver, Canada.</p><p>That was lucky, because the weeks and months after the deal saw tech stocks fall. Twitter's value also waned. Soon, many analysts began to question whether Mr Musk had overpaid for Twitter.</p><p>Publicly, he began to ask a different question - how many real accounts were on Twitter?</p><p>The billionaire - ranked by Forbes and Bloomberg as the world's richest person, with a net worth of about $250bn (£216bn) - had for years complained about the number of bots on the platform.</p><p>After having his offer accepted, he repeatedly asked Twitter to provide data about how many real users it had.</p><p>Twitter executives shared their figure that fewer than 5% of daily active users, based on estimates from randomly sampled accounts, were bots. It appeared to enrage Mr Musk.</p><p>After a long Twitter thread from Mr Agrawal, explaining how the company had reached that figure, Mr Musk responded with the poop emoji.</p><p>The deal was falling apart. Not entirely unexpectedly, on 8 July, Mr Musk announced he wanted to pull out of the deal.</p><p>Was he trying to get a better price for the company or was he genuinely walking away? It was hard to tell.</p><p>Twitter was not having any of it. It argued that Mr Musk's agreement to buy the company was legally binding and unpicking the deal now was not an option.</p><p>With very expensive lawyers on both sides, a court date was set in Delaware for 17 October to decide whether Mr Musk would be forced to buy the company.</p><p>In court documents, Twitter argued it had given him ample information about how many real users it had.</p><p>Mr Musk argued Twitter could have many times as many bots than it had publicly claimed, and even accused the company of fraud.</p><p>The drip, drip of public criticism was hurting Twitter. The vast majority of Twitter's revenue comes from adverts and advertisers were beginning to wonder how many ads were being shown to real people.</p><p>The process was becoming immensely distracting in Twitter HQ too. Some employees relished the idea of Mr Musk becoming their CEO. Many privately - and some publicly - said his purchase would be a disaster for content moderation and the broader goals of the company.</p><p>Mr Musk, Twitter, the judge and journalists, were all preparing for what seemed like an inevitable court case when another remarkable twist occurred.</p><p>From nowhere, after making all sorts of allegations against Twitter, Mr Musk suddenly announced the deal was back on.</p><p>\"Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app,\" he said.</p><p>What had changed his mind? Well perhaps he thought he would lose his court case. A few days before he announced his reversal, he was due to face a deposition by Twitter lawyers. Perhaps he wanted to avoid what would have been a gruelling and likely revealing cross-examination.</p><p>Whatever the reason, you can see why Twitter did not pop the champagne corks. Once bitten, twice shy, Twitter reacted, mutedly. Mr Taylor tweeted that the company was \"committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr Musk\".</p><p>Twitter also asked for the court case to be postponed, not cancelled. Mr Musk's lawyers retorted that Twitter \"won't take yes for an answer\".</p><p>Mr Musk had until 17:00 BST on 28 October to come up with the money.</p><p>Billions would be stumped up by his rich friends and banks. The rest of it, from Mr Musk, by selling some of his shares in Tesla.</p><p>A deal which at times looked intractably, impossibly broken, now appears to have finally been concluded.</p><p>James Clayton is the BBC's North America technology reporter based in San Francisco.

But so far, there has been very little of it.</p><p>The company, which also owns WhatsApp, is struggling as companies cut advertising budgets in the face of economic uncertainty, changes to Apple's privacy settings hurt its targeted ads, and competition from rivals such as TikTok heats up.</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook at university almost two decades ago, acknowledged the firm faced \"near-term challenges\".</p><p>He said the company was focused on becoming more efficient and hinted at job cuts, saying the firm may be a \"smaller organisation\" next year.</p><p>But on a conference call stacked with sceptical analysts, he also maintained that the company was on the right path, as it invests in ways to keep people on its apps and stakes a claim in the emerging world of virtual reality, also known as the metaverse.</p><p>\"There are a lot of things going on right now in the business and in the world,\" he said. \"We're going to resolve each of these things... I think those who are patient and invest with us will end up being rewarded.\"</p><p>Investor confidence plunged in February, when the company revealed it had lost daily users for the first time ever.

This lack of focus and fitness is obscured when growth is easy but deadly when growth slows and technology changes,\" investor Brad Gerstner, chief executive at Altimeter Capital, told the firm in an open letter this week, which called on the company to cut staff and scale back its investments in artificial intelligence and virtual reality, also known as the metaverse.</p><p>Facebook's expenses have ramped up in recent years, as it faced questions about how it was handling the spread of misinformation on its platform and protecting user privacy.</p><p>The company said it was \"making significant changes across the board to operate more efficiently\" and planned to hold headcount flat over the next year.</p><p>That would be a major shift after payrolls surged from about 17,000 at the end of 2016 to more than 87,000, rising 28% just in the last year.</p><p>But it warned that losses in its Reality Labs unit, which works on virtual reality and has seen revenues drop significantly, were likely to grow.</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg said he remains committed to the project, despite the doubters.</p><p>\"I get that a lot of people might disagree with this investment but from what I can tell I think this is going to be a very important thing,\" he said.</p>",

You know you meet all of the criteria, but something doesn't quite feel right.\"</p><p>But the discrepancy was not just about numbers employed but also their opportunities to build careers.</p><p>\"We need senior leaders to match the large numbers of black women currently appearing in tech and engineering adverts, with genuine opportunities to progress into rewarding jobs,\" Ms Hunter said.</p><p>She drew particular attention to the development of artificial intelligence - there is a concern that AI systems can display bias against different ethnicities and genders.</p><p>Greater diversity in senior positions would help ensure that thinking about bias was \"included in every part of your design process\".</p><p>Rashik Parmar, chief executive of the BCS, the professional body for computing, said: \"We will only be able to build the systems that serve everyone if the diversity of humanity is represented in the project teams that design and build these systems.\"</p><p>Nimmi Patel, from trade association Tech UK, said while steps were being taken to support diversity and inclusion within the tech workforce, \"clearly more must be done\".</p><p>\"Both industry and government should work together to inspire, educate, and attract diverse talent to ensure black women - and women in general - enter and progress through the industry,\" she said.</p>",

        "content": "<p>It sounds too good to be true: a plan to harvest solar energy from space and beam it down to Earth using microwaves.</p><p>But it's something that could be happening as soon as 2035, according to Martin Soltau, the co-chairman at Space Energy Initiative (SEI) - a collaboration of industry and academics.</p><p>SEI is working on a project called Cassiopeia, which plans to place a constellation of very large satellites in a high Earth orbit.</p><p>Once deployed the satellites would harvest solar energy and beam it back down to Earth.</p><p>He says the potential is almost unlimited.</p><p>\"In theory it could supply all of the world's energy in 2050,\" he says.</p><p>\"There's sufficient room in orbit for the solar power satellites, and the Sun's supply of energy is vast. A narrow strip around geostationary Earth orbit receives more than 100 times the amount of energy per year than all of humanity is forecast to use in 2050,\" Mr Soltau says.</p><p>Earlier this year, the UK government announced £3m in funding for space-based solar power (SBSP) projects, following an engineering study conducted by consultancy Frazer-Nash that concluded the technology was viable.</p><p>SEI is hoping to get a big chunk of that money.</p><p>Its satellites would be made up of hundreds of thousands of small, identical modules produced in factories on Earth, and assembled in space by autonomous robots, who would also carry out servicing and maintenance.</p><p>The solar energy collected by the satellites would be converted into high frequency radio waves and beamed to a rectifying antenna on Earth, which would convert the radio waves into electricity.</p><p>Each satellite could deliver around 2GW of power into the grid, making each satellite comparable in power output to a nuclear power station.</p><p>Here on Earth, sunlight is diffused by the atmosphere, but in space it comes directly from the sun without interference.</p><p>So a space-based solar panel can collect a lot more energy than a similar sized one on Earth.</p><p>Similar projects are under development elsewhere.</p><p>In the US, for example, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is working on some of the critical technologies needed for such a system, in a project known as Space Solar Power Incremental Demonstrations and Research (SSPIDR).</p><p>These include improving solar cell efficiencies, solar-to-radio frequency conversion and beam forming, as well as reducing the large temperature fluctuations on spacecraft components and creating designs for deployable structures.</p><p>Late last year, the team successfully demonstrated new components for a so-called sandwich tile, which is used to convert solar energy into radio waves.</p><p>The microwave beams might sound alarming, but it has been demonstrated on Earth, and found to be effective and safe for both humans and wildlife.</p><p>\"The beam is microwave, so it's just like the wi-fi that we have all the time, and it's low-intensity, at about a quarter of the intensity of the midday Sun,\" says Mr Soltau.</p><p>\"If you were on the equator in the desert, you'd get about 1,000W per square metre, and this is about a quarter of that: about 240W per square metre. So it's inherently safe in that respect.\"</p><p>More technology of business:</p><p>While many of the biggest hurdles have already been cleared, there are still potential problems.</p><p>\"My personal take on this is that we like to think the technology is there, but it's not quite ready yet for us to embark on a project of such complexity,\" says Dr Jovana Radulovic, a thermodynamics lecturer at the University of Portsmouth, who specialises in renewable energy systems.</p><p>She makes the point that launching a large number of solar panels into space will be expensive and, given that any project could require hundreds of launches, it would generate a lot of carbon dioxide.</p><p>But there is cause for optimism. An environmental analysis of the Cassiopeia project by the University of Strathclyde has concluded that overall, including launch, the carbon footprint could be as little as half that of terrestrial solar, at about 24g of CO2 per kilowatt-hour.</p><p>Meanwhile, says Mr Soltau, the economic case is improving all the time.</p><p>\"The cost of launch has fallen by 90% and is continuing to fall, and this has been game-changing for the economics,\" he says.</p><p>\"Secondly, there have been some real advances in the design of solar power satellites, so that they're much more modular, which provides resilience and reduced production costs. Thirdly, we've got real advances in robotics and autonomous systems.\"</p><p>With only limited funding from the UK government, SEI is hoping to attract private investment for some of the technologies involved. However, warns Dr Radulovic, the proposed timeline may be over-optimistic.</p><p>\"I think with significant investment and focused effort into this area, there's no reason why we couldn't have the system up and running as smaller pilot projects in the foreseeable future,\" she says.</p><p>\"But something on a large scale - we are talking about kilometres of solar arrays - would take a substantially longer time.\"</p>",

But Russia did not initially appear to try and destroy telecommunications and energy sector networks, most likely because they were hoping to utilise them for their own purposes and \"live off the land\", according to one person involved.</p><p>Back in 2015, hackers linked to Russia were able to turn off a power station in the country for hours and after an initial delay, electricity systems have been increasingly targeted this year.</p><p>\"We've seen on a daily basis now the terrible images of the way that the electrical grid in Ukraine has been battered by ballistic strikes and drone strikes from the Russians - they face the same threat and same challenge in the cyber domain,\" Mr Docherty told the BBC.</p><p>In the early months of the war, the teams supported by the UK are also said to have seen specific Russian targeting of databases looking for personal identifiable information at the village, district and city level, which may have been Russian intelligence services seeking to identify and locate officials.</p><p>The full range of hacking groups from all three of Russia's intelligence agencies have been spotted with military intelligence, the GRU, the most active, sources say.</p><p>The most advanced capabilities appear to have been kept back for targeting senior Ukrainian officials. One of the most stealthy groups, codenamed Turla and linked to Russia's FSB security service, was also seen in two locations thanks to mistakes it made. Meanwhile, Russia's foreign intelligence service, the SVR, has been continuing to spy on the US and European governments.</p><p>New Russian teams were also seen being mobilised along with greater innovation in the way malicious software was developed and deployed, those involved claim. There are signs though that the conflict has temporarily disrupted the Russian criminal world with splits between groups over the war, those involved in observing the dark web say.</p><p>Those involved say that despite effective defences, led by the Ukrainians and supported by allies, cyberspace remains heavily contested as Russia continues to seek new ways of carrying out its ambitions.</p><p>\"The UK's support to Ukraine is not limited to military aid - we are drawing on Britain's world-leading expertise to support Ukraine's cyber defences,\" Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said. \"Together, we will ensure that the Kremlin is defeated in every sphere: on land, in the air and in cyber space.\"</p><p>\"The threat remains real and the UK's support package is undoubtedly bolstering Ukraine's defences further,\" said Lindy Cameron, chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre, an arm of the intelligence agency GCHQ.</p>",

Blue for $8/month,\" the billionaire said on Twitter, criticising the old method of blue tick verification as a \"lords and peasants system\".</p><p>But Nu Wexler, former Twitter Head of Global Policy Communications, warned that introducing a fee for blue ticks could make it harder to spot disinformation.</p><p>\"With disinformation as an issue that a lot of platforms are struggling with, verification is one of the ways that journalists, academic researchers and some users use to filter out disinformation or low quality information,\" Mr Wexler told the BBC's Today programme.</p><p>\"If you're offering up blue checks for rent, it makes it harder to sift through disinformation and find high quality information.\"</p><p>Twitter's former method of verifying users for a blue tick included a short online application form, and was reserved for those whose identities were targets for impersonation, such as celebrities, politicians and journalists.</p><p>The company introduced the system in 2009, after it faced a lawsuit accusing it of not doing enough to prevent imposter accounts. According to reports in the Guardian newspaper, there were about 400,000 verified users on Twitter as of 2021.</p><p>But Mr Musk is still facing a hefty challenge as he works to overhaul Twitter's business, which has not posted a profit in years.</p><p>He has said he wants to reduce Twitter's reliance on advertising, even as some companies have grown concerned about advertising on the site under his leadership.</p><p>General Motors - a rival of Mr Musk's electric car company Tesla - said last week it was suspending advertising on the site.</p><p>Meanwhile, some other major brands have more quietly put a temporary halt to advertising on the platform as they wait to see how Mr Musk's changes play out, a media buyer for a leading advertising firm told the BBC.</p><p>On Monday, one of the world's biggest advertising companies, IPG, advised its clients to suspend Twitter adverts for a week, citing a need for more clarity on the Twitter's plans to ensure \"trust and safety\" on the platform. IPG is given billions of pounds per year, by some of the world's biggest brands, to handle their marketing budgets.</p><p>The charge for blue tick privileges drew scepticism after original reports that said the charge could be $20 (£18) monthly.</p><p>Many on the platform echoed the statement of author Stephen King, who wrote in response to reports of changes that instead Twitter \"should pay me\".</p><p>Mr Musk wrote to Mr King saying, \"We need to pay the bills somehow!\"</p>",

Hope, guidance and information,\" she explains. \"That is what the hashtag has done for protesters so far.\"</p><p>But hashtags and Twitter storms are just some of the ways Iranians hear from each other and make the world take notice.</p><p>The reaction of Iranian authorities towards the protests has often been violent.</p><p>Norway-based Iran Human Rights has reported that at least 253 protesters have been killed by security forces, 34 of them children.</p><p>But even in dark times like this Iranians have tried to use humour to keep their spirits up.</p><p>After an evening news bulletin on state run TV was hacked by protesters and replaced with an image of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in flames, people made memes of the TV presenter's stone-faced reaction.</p><p>They also poked fun at the presenter by inserting his face into a viral clip of Snoop Dog and Kevin Hart laughing on their talk show.</p><p>The mandatory hijab laws and what the protesters see as the constant meddling of Islamic laws in their everyday lives have been the targets of much of the criticism on social media.</p><p>At the start of the unrest, many Iranians expressed their reasons for protesting in posts on Twitter and Instagram that started with the Persian phrase \"Baraye...\", or \"For the sake of...\".</p><p>\"For the sake of all the times we had to lower the volume of our music in the car when you guys [morality police] passed by, for all the cassettes we had to hide,\" tweeted Usaneh_dahr.</p><p>Western pop music and Iranian pop music produced outside the country are banned in Iran, and for decades authorities would stop and search cars - and even raid homes - in search of what they called \"indecent music\".</p><p>\"For the sake of all the girls who have to bury the dream of ever going to a professional dance school, for myself,\" tweeted Ferferity.</p><p>Dancing in public in Iran is banned, with the exception of some traditional dances performed by men. Women do not have the right to dance or sing in public under any circumstances, although underground women-only dance classes do exist.</p><p>In 2017, the government even banned Zumba exercise classes in gender-segregated gyms, calling them \"un-Islamic\".</p><p>\"For my mother tongue,\" said another tweet by RMshii94.</p><p>That was a reference to the 43-year-old ban on ethnic minorities teaching their own languages in schools in Iran.</p><p>Those who defy the ban face imprisonment like Zara Mohammadi, a Kurdish language teacher currently serving a five-year sentence for teaching her mother tongue.</p><p>An Iranian pop singer living in Iran, Shervin Hajipour, gathered a number of such tweets and wrote a song about them, entitled \"Baraye...\"</p><p>The video he posted on his Instagram page was viewed 40m times in the first 48 hours it was online.</p><p>\"Baraye…\" has since become an anthem of the protests and has been played at solidarity rallies all over the world.</p><p>Hajipour was arrested on 29 September and released on bail on 4 October. After his release, Hajipour posted an Instagram story saying he regretted that his song was being used by political groups outside the country for \"certain purposes\".</p><p>It is not clear whether he was still in detention when he made the statement and whether he was under duress.</p><p>Activists say Iranian state media routinely broadcast forced \"confessions\" as a means to suppress dissent.</p><p>In the past four decades artists inside Iran have found clever ways to bypass the censorship of the ministry of culture and Islamic guidance.</p><p>Foroozan, a digital creator based in Los Angeles, has been posting art on her Instagram page to support the protests inside Iran.</p><p>One of her works shows the image of a young woman standing in front of the iconic Si-o-Se Pol, a 17th Century arched bridge in Isfahan, and cutting her ponytail.</p><p>The latter is an act that has become one of the symbols of the protests in Iran, and women all over the world have been doing the same in solidarity with Iranian women.</p><p>An artist inside Iran called Benyamin created a short video, entitled Unity for Freedom, that has gone viral on social media.</p><p>It shows the gloved hand of a member of the security forces wielding a truncheon and beating the other hands around him. However, his hand is eventually overcome by the other hands. The video ends with his hand joining theirs in making a victory sign.</p><p>Such online material has meant that the protesters' voices have not been silenced, even as the clampdown continues on and off the streets in Iran</p><p>\"In a country where the people have no media, social media has become the medium of the people,\" says Negin Shiraghaei. \"It is a decentralised media that allows people to be heard and seen.\"</p>",

'It's not going to happen to me. I'm too small.' That was the overwhelming message that I was hearing five years ago,\" says Ms Graham, co-founder of CYDEF, which is based in Canada. \"But yes, it is happening.\"</p><p>Cyber-crimes are expected to cost the world $10.5tn (£9.3tn) by 2025, according to cyber-security research firm Cyber Ventures.</p><p>On the current trajectory, small businesses will absorb most of the hit.</p><p>They are three times more likely to be attacked by cyber-criminals compared to large businesses, cloud security firm Barracuda Networks has found.</p><p>And the risks shot up during the pandemic.</p><p>Between 2020-21, cyber-attacks on small companies surged by more than 150%, according to RiskRecon, a Mastercard company that evaluates companies' cyber-security risk.</p><p>\"The pandemic created a whole new set of challenges and small businesses weren't prepared,\" says Mary Ellen Seale, chief executive of the National Cybersecurity Society, a non-profit that helps small businesses create cyber-security plans.</p><p>In March 2020, at the cusp of the pandemic, a survey of small businesses by broadcaster CNBC found that only 20% planned to invest in cyber-protection.</p><p>Then the Covid-19 lockdowns came into force and firms scrambled to move operations online.</p><p>Working remotely meant more personal devices like smartphones, tablets and laptops had access to sensitive corporate information. However, lockdowns strained budgets, limiting how much companies could spend to protect themselves. Costly in-house experts and cyber-security software were often out of reach.</p><p>The result was weak cyber-security infrastructure that was ripe for hacking.</p><p>\"A lot of the attacks now are coming through them because bad guys know larger organisations have done a pretty good job of protecting their infrastructure. The weakest link is small businesses. And it's really easy to get in there,\" Ms Seale says.</p><p>If it's true to say the US is the engine of the world economy, then small and medium-sized businesses are the fuel that drives that engine.</p><p>Small businesses create nearly two-thirds of new jobs in the workforce and account for 44% of US economic activity. So what's the secret to their success? What challenges do they face and which are the best cities and regions for them to thrive?</p><p>Read more from our Small Business USA series</p><p>For would-be criminals, such attacks are low risk and high reward, since they are less likely to catch the attention of authorities and often the companies themselves.</p><p>It typically takes 200 days from the moment of the hacking until discovery, says Yoohwan Kim, a computer science professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. In many cases, customer complaints are what alert companies to a problem.</p><p>And with one compromised supplier, criminals can access networks of organisations further up the supply chain.</p><p>\"Large businesses depend on small businesses,\" says Ms Seale. \"They are the lifeblood of the United States, and we need a wake-up call.\"</p><p>Small businesses account for more than 99% of companies in the US and employ nearly half of all Americans, playing a critical role in the global economy.</p><p>Dr Kim says they are like the economy's \"Achilles heel\".</p><p>\"They may be a small company but what they sell to large businesses could be very important. If they're hacked, [their product] won't be fed into supply chains and everything will be affected,\" says Dr Kim.</p><p>Cyber-attacks can be devastating to small businesses, prompting their products to be removed from supply chains and triggering legal fees, investigations and regulatory filings.</p><p>About 60% of small businesses shut down within six months of facing an attack, the National Cybersecurity Alliance estimates.</p><p>\"The cost could reach thousands of dollars. Some companies simply can't pay that kind of money,\" Dr Kim says. \"They just can't handle it.\"</p><p>But although small businesses are the most vulnerable, Ms Graham says that most cyber-security tools have been made for big companies, and are often difficult to understand and install without an in-house expert.</p><p>\"That's a huge challenge for small companies that don't understand what these people are trying to sell them,\" she says.</p><p>Experts say there are simple steps small firms can take to improve their protections, such as creating basic response plans and identifying what and where critical data is.</p><p>Educating employees on how to avoid and detect attacks is also important, since the vast majority of data breaches involve human error.</p><p>Attacks in which cyber-criminals hacked into business emails were the costliest cyber-threat during the pandemic, amounting to $1.8bn in reported losses, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p><p>Also known as spear phishing, such hacks use a targeted attack, unlike more traditional strategies like spam, which reaches large numbers of people. Ms Graham describes the tool as \"the new frontier in criminal activity\" and says it has become the most common type of cyber-attack her clients face.</p><p>But firms should not despair, says Ms Seale.</p><p>\"The biggest thing is to convey to small business that it's not hopeless. It's not an unsurmountable task,\" she says.</p>",

        "content": "<p>China's leader Xi Jinping insists there will be no swerving from zero-Covid - but the ongoing chaos which his government's policy is delivering is there for all to see at the Foxconn plant in the city of Zhengzhou.</p><p>What drove the mass breakout at the world's largest assembly line for Apple computers was fear, panic and ignorance.</p><p>Foxconn, the company which runs this enormous factory, must shoulder a portion of the blame for this but really the root cause is this country's inflexible, strict, zero-Covid approach.</p><p>The BBC has spoken to workers there who paint a picture of an urgent need to escape for their own safety. It may not be rational, but some say they feared for their lives.</p><p>Take a 21-year-old Foxconn worker who had been hearing the rumours for a while. The more the stories and speculation continued, the more extreme they were becoming.</p><p>It didn't help that her immediate bosses at Foxconn were saying that there were no Covid infections in the factory while the company was telling the media that there were no \"symptomatic\" infections. And yet there were plenty of known examples of staff who had tested positive.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of staff had been ordered not to leave this huge industrial complex. After workers were confined to only the worker dormitories and other parts of the factory, the rumour mill stepped up another gear.</p><p>This young factory worker heard that the army was going to come in and take control so as to enforce a type of giant \"living with Covid\" experiment which involved allowing everyone in that part of Zhengzhou city to get sick.</p><p>According to these rumours, the plan was to see how many of them would die. Then, if the carnage wasn't too bad, this would provide a guide as to whether the rest of China could open up or not.</p><p>Sentiments were spreading on their chat groups like: \"Foxconn is going to take my life.\"</p><p>She clearly wasn't the only one hearing this and workers started busting out. On Saturday night footage went round of a yellow barrier fence being pushed down to allow some to escape.</p><p>By the next morning, she already had word from some of her friends that they'd made it all the way back to their hometowns.</p><p>Half those in her eight-person dormitory had gone. She packed a bag but couldn't take everything.</p><p>Another worker told us she too suddenly panicked before leaving. \"To be honest, I did not think it would be that bad at first,\" she said.</p><p>\"But then people around me started getting infected. Positive cases in other dorms were not being taken away to quarantine for several days. Those I know who kept working, all started confirming as positive.\"</p><p>Apart from the Foxconn workers, because most of Zhengzhou city is currently under some form of lockdown, phone app health codes will not permit anyone to leave, at least officially.</p><p>This means that, even if public transport was operating, you would not be allowed on board and this includes taxis.</p><p>The solution for workers at Foxconn - jump over the fence and simply start walking. For some, this has meant travelling on foot with whatever they can carry for more than 100km.</p><p>You don't have to search hard to see images with extended lines of mostly young people dragging luggage along the sides of highways.</p><p>Ordinary people driving through have taken pity and picked up workers, ferrying them as far as possible.</p><p>In scenes reminiscent of the great depression a century ago, workers have been piling onto the backs of trucks, sometimes lighting small fires to keep warm.</p><p>The footage of this has kept coming, first spreading around Henan Province then across China and around the world.</p><p>This is full tilt zero-Covid economic disruption.</p><p>A key problem has been widespread ignorance about the nature of the illness. In much of China, people are as terrified of catching the virus as if it were cancer.</p><p>The Chinese government has done little to alter these misunderstandings and, in fact, has often made them worse.</p><p>The narrative from those in charge here has been that elsewhere, Covid has been cutting a swathe through the population, but Chinese people should consider themselves lucky because they have the Communist Party to protect them with the zero-Covid approach.</p><p>It is true that this strategy has stopped the country's hospitals from being swamped and it is true that Covid has resulted in a tragic loss of lives.</p><p>However, it is also true that - for the vast majority of infected people who have been vaccinated - catching the virus means a few days sick at home and nothing more.</p><p>This last point is something that many in China are completely unaware of.</p><p>So when the workers of Foxconn made it to their hometowns and were put into hastily constructed quarantine facilities at local high schools, for them this was not as bad as the Covid hell they imagined was descending upon them back at their factory.</p><p>Staff the BBC has spoken to say they don't know if they will be able to return to work at Foxconn; or if they will be able to even retrieve their remaining belongings in their dorms. They expect that they have lost their work attendance bonuses which boost pay after you do a certain number of days at work in a row. However, again, none of this matters as much as feeling safe.</p><p>Naturally, the sight of workers fleeing their place of employment has caused an outcry and Foxconn has responded.</p><p>The company announced that those who want to go will be allowed to leave on secure buses which have now been organised in coordination with other towns and which will take people directly to quarantine sites, thus ensuring a much more calm and orderly process.</p><p>It has also announced the quadrupling of bonuses for staff who remain on site and don't take leave.</p><p>In an announcement, Foxconn said that this was part of an effort to \"gradually resume orderly production\".</p><p>As an official lockdown has been re-imposed on the entire Zhengzhou Airport Economic Zone, the exodus from the factory appears to have slowed to a trickle for the time being.</p><p>One volunteer, who has been distributing food and water along the roads, told us that what looked like thousands getting away last weekend had reduced to dozens at a time and even less by the middle of this week.</p><p>If Foxconn can't properly manage this crisis, in the short term, it will hit global supply chains for Apple and other products.</p><p>But, in the long run, this shows a much bigger problem for China.</p><p>The government's system of controlling Covid is not capable of operating without causing significant disruption, not only to people's lives, but potentially to key sectors of economy.</p><p>For China's leader Xi Jinping, this may not be as important as maintaining political control. But there are only two paths ahead - alter the zero-Covid approach or see more Foxconn-style upheaval in the future.</p>",

Disney, for example, is due to roll out an advert supported service in December in the US. That plan will start at $7.99 a month.</p><p>Netflix has said customers on its ad-supported plan will face an average of four to five minutes of adverts per hour.</p><p>\"I wouldn't mind watching an advert if it meant it was cheaper,\" students Lottie and Frankie told the BBC.</p><p>For now, both aged 20, said they weren't directly concerned with the expense of Netflix, since they watch on family accounts.</p><p>With Netflix warning of plans to crack down on password sharing, they said the new option could be \"good for students\".</p><p>Among non-subscribers, however, a survey in the US by DISQO found only 25% to 35% were interested in signing up for a service with ads.</p><p>Even if the audience is not large, it could still prove lucrative for Netflix.</p><p>There was a \"flurry\" of interest from advertisers after Netflix announced the service, though some brands became \"more reticent\" when they found out how much the advertising would cost, said Liz Duff, head of commercial and operations for Total Media, which buys advertising slots for big household name brands,</p><p>Others, however, were \"very keen to get involved in the initial launch phase\", she added.</p><p>Netflix could generate $830m from commercials next year and more than $1bn by 2024, according to estimates by Insider Intelligence.</p><p>But forecasting analyst Peter Newman cautioned that the new plan will draw most of its sign-ups from Netflix's existing audience, rather than expanding the pool of viewers.</p><p>\"An ad-supported tier isn't going to reverse Netflix's fortunes overnight,\" he said.</p><p>Additional reporting by Charlotte McDonald</p>",

        "content": "<p>Nearly $2bn (£1.75bn) has been spent on virtual land in the past 12 months, as people and companies race to get a foothold in the metaverse, research shows.</p><p>But we are years away from the metaverse emerging as a single immersive space online where people can live, work and play in virtual reality. So is the land grab one big gamble?</p><p>With her giant dark red mohican and permanent cigarette, artist Angie Taylor's avatar does not look like a typical land mogul. But she is one of a growing breed of people staking a claim to new virtual worlds.</p><p>\"I bought my first metaverse parcel in July 2020 and paid about £1,500. I bought it for exhibiting my own work, but also for running metaverse events that would promote my art and also other people's art,\" she says.</p><p>Angie, from Brighton, built two galleries full of strange and beautiful digital artwork, which is being sold in cryptocurrency, on her land in the Voxels world.</p><p>Angie's plots are about the size of a small family house (if you compare them to the size of her avatar). The tallest stretches up over three floors and has a roof terrace with a white-and-black-striped road crossing, and a pink taxi permanently driving back and forth just for fun.</p><p>But you get a real sense of the scale of this world from the air.</p><p>\"Hold down the F key and you can fly up to take a look at my neighbourhood,\" Angie explains. Above her gallery you can see thousands of identical boxes of land stretching to the horizon.</p><p>Voxels is one of dozens of virtual worlds that describe themselves as metaverses. It is confusing, because people often talk about \"the metaverse\" as if there was only one. But until one platform starts to dominate, or these disparate worlds join together, companies are selling land and experiences in their own versions.</p><p>Researchers at metaverse analysts DappRadar say that $1.93bn worth of cryptocurrency has been spent buying virtual land in the past year alone, with $22m of that spent on about 3,000 parcels of land in Voxels.</p><p>Dapp Radar can monitor this because Voxels is built on the Ethereum cryptocurrency system, in which, like all virtual currencies, every transaction is logged and published on a public blockchain.</p><p>One of the most popular worlds is the cartoony Decentraland. Launched in 2020, parcels of land there are selling for thousands, sometimes millions of dollars. Samsung, UPS and Sotheby's are among those who have bought land and built shops and visitor centres there.</p><p>Luxury fashion brand Philipp Plein also owns a plot about the size of four football pitches, which it hopes will eventually contain a metaverse store and gallery.</p><p>However, owner Mr Plein says his mum is not convinced by his $1.5m purchase.</p><p>\"My mother called me and said, 'what did you do? Why? Are you crazy, why do you spend so much money, what is this?',\" he says.</p><p>Mr Plein has been selling goods in 24 different cryptocurrencies online for more than a year. Earlier in 2022, he opened a new shop on London's Old Bond Street selling clothing and some non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in exchange for cryptocoins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as pounds.</p><p>He says opening the shop helped him learn more about the metaverse and adds: \"I made a bold step spending so much on a piece of land.</p><p>\"But I was thinking that I've had over 24 years with my brand and what would I have to do if I was starting again?\"</p><p>However, with the general collapse in the value of cryptocurrencies, Dapp Radar says metaverse real estate values are near a one-year low</p><p>In Sandbox, another of the crypto metaverses, Adidas, Atari, Ubisoft, Binance, Warner Music and Gucci are just some of the multinationals buying land, and building experiences to sell and promote their products and services.</p><p>Gucci has also built in Roblox, which alongside other big gaming platforms like Minecraft and Fortnite, is seen as the most mainstream of the fledgling metaverses.</p><p>These gaming corporations do not sell land and are run without the use of any blockchain technology. However, they already have some of the key ingredients that sci-fi writers say we need for a true metaverse:</p><p>Gucci Town has had more than 36 million visits in the year since it was launched, while Nike Land has recorded more than 25 million in 11 months. In Gucci Town, players can buy clothing for their avatars with real money. In Nike Land they can obtain T-shirts and shoes for avatars with points earned by playing games.</p><p>Fashion seems to be the industry most keen to take the opportunities and risks associated with the metaverse.</p><p>Digital-only fashion house The Fabricant, based in Amsterdam, only makes clothing for avatars, designing collections and bespoke garments for users of Decentraland, Sandbox and other crypto metaverses.</p><p>\"When we started, everybody called us crazy, because they were like, 'why would you need this?'. But we very strongly believed in the idea that in the future, people would wear the digital items,\" says co-founder and lead designer Amber Jae Slooten.</p><p>The Fabricant's record sale so far is a digital dress which fetched $19,000, though it was sold as an NFT - a digital art piece - and has not been worn by the owner's avatar.</p><p>The company just raised $14m in funding from investors betting on the idea that many of us will soon be living part of our lives in the metaverse.</p><p>But it is not certain if and when that will happen. The crypto metaverses are generally sparsely populated and only really used when events are held, and even then only thousands, and not millions, of people attend.</p><p>Even in the virtual world in which Meta, owners of Facebook and Instagram, is investing billions of dollars, leaked memos show people are not staying for long.</p><p>But Ms Slooten is convinced that as these worlds develop, people will come.</p><p>\"There will be for sure a mass market in this because if you think about the younger generation, they already play games. For them there's no distinction between virtual and real. But it still needs to be built.\"</p>",

I have been working with different industries like survey mapping, asset inspection, agriculture and many others,\" he says.</p><p>Drones come in all shapes and sizes. The smaller ones typically have three of four rotors and can carry something small like a camera. The biggest, usually used by the military, look more like aeroplanes and can carry substantial payloads.</p><p>Mr Nath, 23, had been designing drones, but decided that being certified to fly them would bring more job satisfaction and financial rewards.</p><p>A five-day course was enough to get him started, and he's now flight-testing drones that will be used for mapping.</p><p>Next he wants to master flying heavier and more complicated models.</p><p>Mr Nath is reaping the benefits of a big push by the Indian government into the drone industry.</p><p>In February this year India banned the import of drones, except for those needed by the military or for research and development.</p><p>The government wants to develop a home-grown industry that can design and assemble drones and make the components that go into their manufacture.</p><p>\"Drones can be significant creators of employment and economic growth due to their versatility, and ease of use, especially in India's remote areas,\" says Amber Dubey, former joint secretary at the Ministry of Civil Aviation.</p><p>\"Given its traditional strengths in innovation, information technology, frugal engineering and its huge domestic demand, India has the potential of becoming a global drone hub by 2030,\" he tells the BBC.</p><p>Over the next three years Mr Dubey sees as much as 50bn rupees (£550m; $630m) invested in the sector.</p><p>Neel Mehta is the co-founder of Asteria Aerospace, which has been building drones for 10 years. He welcomes the government's efforts to boost the sector.</p><p>It has allowed his company to expand beyond building drones for the defence sector and move into new areas.</p><p>\"Drone companies now have a clear growth roadmap, large order books and promising future trajectory. In India, we now have drones being used in real-world, impactful large-scale applications, while being economically viable,\" says Mr Mehta.</p><p>Currently drones do all sorts of jobs in India. Police use them for monitoring the traffic and border security forces use them to search for smugglers and traffickers.</p><p>They are also increasingly common in the farming sector, where they are used to monitor the health of crops and spray them with fertiliser and pesticides.</p><p>However, despite the excitement and investment around India's drone industry, even those in the sector advise caution.</p><p>\"India has set a goal of being a hub of drones by 2030, but I think we should be cautious because we at present don't not have an ecosystem and technology initiatives in place,\" says Rajiv Kumar Narang, from the Drone Federation of India.</p><p>He says the industry needs a robust regulator that can oversee safety and help develop an air traffic control system for drones.</p><p>That will be particularly important as the aircraft become larger, says Mr Narang.</p><p>\"Initiatives have to come from the government. A single entity or a nodal ministry has to take this forward if we want to reach a goal of being the hub by 2030,\" he says.</p><p>India also lacks the network of firms needed to make all the components that go into making a drone.</p><p>At the moment many parts, including batteries, motors and flight controllers are imported. But the government is confident an incentive scheme will help boost domestic firms.</p><p>\"The components industry will take two to three years to build, since it traditionally works on low margin and high volumes,\" says Mr Dubey.</p><p>Despite those reservations, firms are confident there will be demand for drones and people to fly them.</p><p>Chirag Shara is the chief executive of Drone Destination, which has trained more than 800 pilots and instructors since the rules on drone use were first relaxed in August 2021.</p><p>He estimates that India will need up to 500,000 certified pilots over the next five years.</p><p>\"With 5G around the corner, the drone technology will have the platform to unleash its full potential, especially for long-range, high-endurance operations,\" he says.</p><p>More technology of business:</p><p>Some companies are already using autonomous drones that use artificial intelligence (AI) to get to their destinations. Could that eliminate the need for drone pilots in the future?</p><p>It's not something that concerns newly certified pilot Uddesh Nath.</p><p>\"Drones will always require a pilot or someone remotely controlling and monitoring them. Different drones require different handling and AI is not yet that advanced.</p><p>\"Even if it learns to control itself, we cannot teach the drone to react in every situation,\" he says.</p>",

One way to fix the problem is by making a dent in the wage bill.</p><p>Simon Balmain, a senior community manager for Twitter in the UK, told the BBC that he believed he has been laid off, because he was logged out of his work laptop and Slack messaging programme.</p><p>\"Everyone got an email saying that there was going to be a large reduction in headcount, and then around an hour later, folks started getting their laptops remotely wiped and access to Slack and Gmail revoked,\" he said.</p><p>\"Most UK folks are probably asleep and don't know yet.

We're all looking out for each other and the outreach of love and support has been incredible to see,\" Mr Balmain said.</p><p>Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, suggested some senior staff were asked to make lists of employees to be cut on their teams.</p><p>Cryptocurrency platform Binance invested in Twitter as part of Mr Musk's takeover. Earlier, Changpeng Zhao, its chief executive, said that \"a slimmer workforce would make more sense\".</p><p>Mr Zhao, who was speaking at the Web Summit in Lisbon, also criticised the platform for having been slow to roll out new features, given its level of staffing.</p><p>The cost-cutting follows criticism of Twitter's efforts to raise money by proposing to charge $8 (£7) a month for a \"verified\" blue check-mark.</p><p>In addition to the verification badge, those who pay could have their tweets promoted more widely and see fewer adverts.</p><p>Mr Musk has tweeted of his plan: \"We need to pay the bills somehow.\"</p><p>Twitter has not made a profit in several years and its number of users has remained fairly static at about 300 million a month.</p><p>Many experts suggest that Mr Musk, the world's richest man, overpaid for the company, given current economic conditions and the depressed values of many tech stocks.</p><p>But Brandon Borrman, Twitter's former head of global communications, in a BBC interview, questioned how Twitter could justify asking people to pay in order to remain on an \"equal playing field\" with other users.</p><p>It is not clear how the cuts will affect the platform's operations. Mr Musk has a reputation for being ruthless when it comes to staff.</p><p>US media reports already speak of long hours spent by some staff to meet Mr Musk's demands in the aftermath of the takeover.</p><p>In May, Mr Musk said his work ethic expectations would be \"extreme\", but less than he demanded of himself.</p><p>As part of the takeover agreement, nine members of Twitter's board departed the company, leaving self-styled \"Chief Twit\" Mr Musk as the sole director.</p><p>The move was seen as cementing Mr Musk's control over the company.</p><p>Among those leaving were chairman Bret Taylor and chief executive Parag Agrawal.</p><p>Other senior figures have also posted about leaving, or are reported to have left, including chief financial officer Ned Segal.</p><p>As senior figures left, US media reported that a number of Mr Musk's allies joined Twitter.</p><p>Additional reporting by Chris Vallance</p><p>Do you work for Twitter?

Anyone could pay to get verified and not only would they receive a blue tick, but they would also have priority in replies, mentions and search. In other words, accounts could now pay for prestige - and to be amplified on the platform.</p><p>The policy announcement instantly raised questions about authenticity and fairness. Content would now float above others because the user had paid their monthly sub.</p><p>Mr Musk said his policy was a way of addressing Twitter's bot problem.

About half of Twitter's 7,500 employees were then released.</p><p>That huge cull in staff raised more than a few eyebrows.

        "content": "<p>In the wake of Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter, some users have been seeking alternative platforms. One of the biggest beneficiaries has been Mastodon. But what is it?</p><p>The social network says it now has over 655,000 users - with over 230,000 having joined in the last week.</p><p>On the surface Mastodon looks like Twitter - account users write posts (called \"toots\"), which can be replied to, liked and re-posted, and they can follow each other.</p><p>Under the bonnet, though, it works in a different way.</p><p>That's one of the reasons it is attracting fresh users, but it has caused some confusion to new people signing up.</p><p>The platform is six years old but its current activity is unprecedented and it is struggling under the weight of new joiners.</p><p>Here's a brief guide to finding your way around it.</p><p>The first thing you have to do when you sign up is choose a server. There are loads of them, They are themed - many by country, city or interest - like UK, social, technology, gaming and so on.</p><p>It doesn't hugely matter which one you are on because you will be able to follow users on all the others anyway, but it does give you a starting community who are more likely to post things you are interested in as well.</p><p>Some of the popular ones - such as social and UK - are currently running very slowly because of demand.</p><p>Ryan Wild, who is running the MastodonApp.UK server via his firm Superior Networks, said he had over 6,000 new joiners in 24 hours and had to pause registration.</p><p>\"I wanted to see what the hype was about,\" he said.</p><p>\"I stood the server up at 10pm Friday night, and I woke up next morning to 1,000 people I didn't know would rock up.\"</p><p>The server you choose becomes part of your user name - so for example, I used my current Twitter handle, zsk, and chose the UK server, making my user name @zsk@mastodonapp.uk. And that's my address there - what you would look up to find me.</p><p>If you are on the same server, you can search just using the person's name, but if they are on a different server you will need their full address.</p><p>Unlike Twitter, Mastodon won't suggest followers you may be interested in.</p><p>You can also search hashtags.</p><p>Okay, this is complicated, but I'm going to try to keep it very simple.</p><p>Mastodon is not one platform. It's not one \"thing\" and it is not owned by one person or firm. All of these different servers link together, and form a collective network, but they are owned by different people and organisations.</p><p>This is called decentralised, and fans of decentralised platforms like them for exactly this reason - they can't be run at the whim of a single entity, bought or sold.</p><p>However the downside of this is that you are instead at the whim of the person or organisation running your server - if they decide to abandon it, you lose your account. Mastodon is asking server owners to give their users three months notice if they decide to close it.</p><p>The original founder of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, is working on a new network called BlueSky, by the way - and he has said he wants that to be decentralised too.</p><p>This is a real hot potato. At the moment all the servers have their own moderation rules, and some have none. Some servers are choosing not to link to others that are full of bots or seem to have a high quantity of hateful content - this means they will not be visible to those on the servers where they are blocked. Posts can also be reported to the server owners.</p><p>If it's hate speech or illegal content then those owners can delete it - but that does not necessarily delete it everywhere.</p><p>It's going to be a huge issue if this platform continues to grow.</p><p>There are already reports of people being targeted by hateful content and the BBC has seen examples of homophobic abuse.</p><p>No. There are no ads although there's also nothing to stop you writing a post promoting your company or product.</p><p>Mastodon also doesn't offer a curated experience like Twitter does in terms of how you view posts - you generally see what your followers are saying, as they say it.</p><p>It depends which server you are on - some are asking for donations, as they don't get paid, but it is largely free.</p><p>You can follow Zoe Kleinman on Mastodon @zsk@mastodonapp.uk (or Twitter @zsk)</p>",

        "content": "<p>Disinformation and Social Media correspondent Marianna Spring set up a series of social media accounts to investigate what voters are being recommended online at a turbulent time for US politics. After over two months of running the profiles, this is what she found.</p><p>I open up Britney's Instagram and click on an account that's been recommended in her feed. I'm greeted by a meme falsely declaring that President Joe Biden never really won the 2020 election, and several others targeting named female politicians with misogynistic comments and abusive language.</p><p>Britney is one of five profiles I've created to track what US voters can be recommended and exposed to online ahead of the midterm elections. While social media sites say they are committed to tackling disinformation and hate on their platforms ahead of the poll, for my undercover voters, misleading and violent posts appear to have only increased in recent weeks.</p><p>My five voters were created to represent views from across the US political spectrum, based on data gathered by the Pew Research Centre. I gave each of them a profile on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube and Twitter, with names and computer-generated photos.</p><p>They are:</p><p>For all of them, I followed additional accounts when they were suggested, as well as keeping up their original interests.</p><p>While these profiles can't offer an exhaustive insight into what every US voter could be seeing - and they don't have friends or followers - they do give us a snapshot of what voters across the political spectrum are being exposed to.</p><p>The Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), which tracks extremism and disinformation worldwide, says that election conspiracy claims and abusive language aimed at politicians online have intensified in the run-up to the midterms.</p><p>As I've checked into each of my undercover voters' accounts over the past two months, it's Britney's that have been most frequently exposed to violent and misleading content.</p><p>When setting up her account, I liked pages and accounts that supported Mr Trump, opposed mandatory vaccination and questioned the motives of billionaires. These topics appear to have been a gateway to more extreme content, when compared with the other undercover voters.</p><p>Larry was exposed to posts featuring misleading claims about the 2020 election and abusive language directed at politicians, while Emma was also recommended several pages using abusive language aimed at supporters of Donald Trump and Supreme Court Justices, but nothing on the scale of what Britney was recommended.</p><p>When I logged onto Instagram in particular, I found she was recommended more and more accounts that made false claims about fraudulent voting and denied that President Biden won the election.</p><p>They regularly featured hashtags like #Trumpwon in their profile descriptions and on their posts, and shared memes about the riots on the Capitol claiming that \"January 6th wasn't an insurrection\".</p><p>Britney's profile was also shown TikTok videos from accounts promoting conspiracy theories that the election was rigged, also repeating the phrase \"Trump Won\".</p><p>Last week, Instagram showed her conspiracy theories contradicting the police account of what happened when Paul Pelosi, the husband of US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was violently attacked in their home. Posts also made light of the violence.</p><p>Finally, pages recommended to Britney's Instagram account also featured posts talking about female politicians in abusive and misogynistic terms.</p><p>The most frequent targets were Nancy Pelosi, Kamala Harris, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton. There were comments about them performing sex acts, and slurs about their appearances, alongside criticism of their politics. While posts often spoke about Joe Biden and Donald Trump in hateful terms, they were not subject to the same sexualised language.</p><p>This language was unique to Britney's accounts. On Facebook, Emma was recommended pages that promoted naming and shaming racists and Trump supporters, but the rhetoric had not escalated in the same way.</p><p>Gabriela was increasingly recommended right-leaning content on social media, often about inflation and the cost of living crisis, but it stopped short of the more extreme disinformation and hate that Britney encountered.</p><p>Larry and Michael were targeted more frequently by official campaign adverts and content from the political parties themselves, especially on sites like YouTube. For Larry, the messaging was focused on crime, inflation and immigration. For Michael, the adverts and posts talked about abortion, climate change and education.</p><p>As well as noting the uptick in hate ahead of the midterms, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue says disinformation online has focused on conspiracies about the Biden administration, as well as the issue of voting in specific US states.</p><p>\"That, when combined with social media product features and failed policies, is giving permission to more hate and vitriol,\" said Jiore Craig, the ISD's Head of Elections and Digital Integrity.</p><p>In particular, the ISD found election conspiracy theories in short-form video formats across several platforms. Social media companies have \"inconsistent and insufficient moderation policies\" to deal with this kind of content, its research concludes.</p><p>The research also expresses concerns that the major social media companies are not taking election denials seriously, although they have made various commitments to tackling disinformation and hate ahead of the midterms.</p><p>In August, Meta - which owns Facebook and Instagram - said it would devote \"hundreds of people across more than 40 teams\" to ensure the security and safety of the midterms, and apply \"learnings\" from the past election.</p><p>Meta told the BBC that it has robust measures in place to combat misinformation, including partnerships with 10 fact-checking organisations in the US.</p><p>It also said it has \"clear policies about what is and isn't allowed on our platforms\" and \"continually reviews content\" to see if it violates policies.</p><p>TikTok also announced its own \"commitment to election integrity\" ahead of the vote, saying it had partnered with fact-checking organisations. It told the BBC it took its \"responsibility to protect the integrity of our platform and elections with utmost seriousness\".</p><p>Populist Right Britney, Progressive Left Emma and even Apolitical Gabriela have been recommended increasingly polarised content on Twitter over the past two months, particularly on immigration, crime and climate change.</p><p>Britney's account was also shown a conspiracy theory shared by Elon Musk about the attack on Mr Pelosi - Mr Musk later deleted his tweet.</p><p>There are concerns that lay-offs and potential changes to moderation policies on Twitter, which Mr Musk now owns, could also lead to an increase in online disinformation just before voters head to the polls.</p><p>Several of the Instagram accounts that Britney has been recommended promoting claims that Trump really won the 2020 election have also praised Mr Musk for buying Twitter and referenced their plans to return to the site.</p><p>Twitter says that while it has lost employees, their \"core moderation capabilities remain in place\".</p>",

He suggests one possibility would be Nato's F16 fighter, of which thousands have been built.</p><p>But the drawback here is that it needs long, pristine runways which would be vulnerable to Russian targeting. Another candidate, he says, is Sweden's Grippen aircraft which would be able to operate from small, discreet forest bases.</p><p>But Western nations have been wary of providing Ukraine with such powerful weapons that they provoke President Vladimir Putin into taking even more drastic action.</p><p>So far, Nato-supplied weapons have nearly all been for clearly defined defensive purposes, such as pushing back Russian artillery, ambushing invading tank columns or shooting attack drones out of the sky. Sending advanced combat aircraft would be a major step up, risking escalation between Moscow and the West.</p><p>Still, the RUSI report calls on the West not to be complacent on the issue of Ukraine's air defence.</p><p>It concludes that it's only because Russia has been unable to destroy Ukraine's surface-to-air missile systems that its air force has not repeated its strategy in Syria of reducing large parts of the cities to rubble.

Gayle even admits that she moved dangerously close to the edge while doing so.</p><p>It was after that moment, for which she was berated by her husband, that she decided to quit social media.</p><p>\"I was like, 'this has got to stop,'\" recalls Gayle, a British expat who lives near the Spanish city of Granada. \"Taking a photo was previously the first thing I thought about when I got out of the car.</p><p>\"Thinking all the time about creating content, and worrying about what to say, was taking up too much headspace and getting me down.\"</p><p>A week later she posted on Facebook and Instagram that she would be leaving the platforms. \"It was amazing how it was my most-liked post on Instagram. Everyone was commenting 'I wish I could do that' and 'you're so brave'.\"</p><p>Gayle, who is a life coach specialising in helping people give up drinking, worked out that she spent about 11 hours a week, on average, on social media.</p><p>She says the thought of ditching the apps was much scarier than actually leaving.</p><p>\"Once the initial withdrawal was over, I didn't have cravings,\" she says. \"It was quite liberating. I am now more than six months into my social media sobriety, and I have regained some of that sense of freedom and peace that I experienced when I quit alcohol.\"</p><p>For many of us, a hefty chunk of our time is spent on social media. One global study in July estimated that the average person spends two hours and 29 minutes per day on such apps and websites. That's five minutes more than a year earlier.</p><p>While some people might think that this is a bad habit that they should cut down on, for others it's an actual addiction that they need help to overcome.</p><p>UK Addiction Treatment (UKAT), an organisation that runs centres to treat social media addiction, says it has seen a 5% increase in the number of people seeking its help for the problem over the past three years.</p><p>\"Society has undoubtedly developed a strong dependency to social media, and the internet in general since the pandemic,\" says Nuno Albuquerque, a counsellor at UKAT.</p><p>Increased awareness of these concerns has led to more people like Gayle quitting social media, or at least spending less time on it. And the providers are noticing.</p><p>Earlier this year, Facebook's owner Meta reported that its number of daily active users had declined for the first time in its history. Meanwhile, a leaked internal Twitter report last month said that its previously most active users were now tweeting less. Twitter did not deny the accuracy of the leak.</p><p>Even Twitter's new owner, billionaire businessman Elon Musk, speculated earlier this year: \"Is Twitter dying?\" And in recent days his takeover has resulted in some Hollywood celebrities saying they will quit Twitter, unhappy with Musk's views on free speech and plans for the service.</p><p>But back in the real world, what are the other reasons why people are leaving social media?</p><p>Entrepreneur Urvashi Agarwal previously quit Instagram in 2014, but that only lasted for about a year. In August this year she deleted her personal account for a second time, and she's adamant that this time there will be no going back.</p><p>\"I'm definitely done,\" says the founder of UK teabag brand JP's Originals, who lives in London.</p><p>\"One hundred per cent. Not only is it just wasting so much time, but it feels like there's just less and less privacy in the world. Everything you do is constantly out there.\"</p><p>Urvashi also no longer uses Twitter or Facebook, and she finds it liberating. \"I love it. I now read 15 pages of a book every night instead.\"</p><p>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.</p><p>Hilda Burke, psychotherapist and author of The Phone Addiction Workbook, says there's now more widespread awareness about how much time people are \"frittering\" away on social media platforms.</p><p>\"This is now easily quantifiable, as most phones show you the breakdown of how you're spending your time online,\" she says.</p><p>\"Seeing how it all adds up can serve as a powerful wake-up call. Many of my clients have expressed a correlation between heavy social media use and poor sleep and increased anxiety.\"</p><p>She advises that people quitting social media should let all their friends know, so they don't continue to try to contact you via the sites. \"Offer other ways of getting in touch... perhaps an old-fashioned phone call could serve the relationship better in the absence of direct messages.\"</p><p>Kashmir, who declined to give her surname, is a 27-year-old public relations (PR) executive from Rochester in Kent. She quit Instagram 10 months ago, having previously also walked away from Snapchat.</p><p>\"The main driver was my mental health,\" she says. \"There's a lot of pressure to live up to what other people are doing, which isn't really representative, or the reality of that person.</p><p>\"I would find myself scrolling at night, and then having a bad night's sleep, and then waking up not feeling refreshed. Now I'm not making comparisons in my day-to-day life, and I don't really know what celebrities are doing.</p><p>\"It allows me to be more present and firm, and committed to the decisions I make rather than being influenced.\"</p><p>Kashmir adds that not being on Instagram and Snapchat does not affect her PR work, and that she still uses LinkedIn if she is ever looking for a new job.</p><p>UKAT's Nuno Albuquerque says social media can be addictive for many reasons, the main one being that it is a form of escapism, especially for the younger generation.</p><p>\"It's simply a way of connecting without connection, and it's a 24/7 comfort blanket of company for many. But addiction feeds off isolation, and if someone spends more time living online than in the moment, then they will naturally become isolated, and addiction can creep in.\"</p><p>He welcomes the fact that more people are quitting social media. \"It's likely that we're eventually starting to realise the damage it can cause to our relationships, mental health and our experience of real-world moments.\"</p><p>Back in Spain, Gayle Macdonald says she's happier without social media. \"It's so liberating to sit and have a cup of tea without worrying about the image, the caption and whether or not it should be a story, or a reel, or a post. There really is more to life.\"</p>",

Instead, the 45-year-old did what a great many people would do - she looked for the best spot to take a selfie for her social media accounts. Gayle even admits that she moved dangerously close to the edge while doing so.",

        "content": "<p>An old diesel freight train in British Columbia, Canada is about to get a new lease of life.</p><p>Local firm Hydrogen in Motion (H2M) is currently converting the Green Goat locomotive to run on a mix of hydrogen and battery power.</p><p>The so-called switcher locomotive performs tasks such as transporting small loads of lumber or animal feed at rail yards.</p><p>If all goes to plan, H2M will have the engine running by the end of this year, or early next.</p><p>\"With the successful demonstration of this we would be looking at much larger trains as well,\" says H2M president and chief executive Grace Quan. \"We'd be looking at converting entire fleets.\"</p><p>Hydrogen, which emits water but no carbon dioxide when burned, is often touted as a fuel of the future.</p><p>There are already a few hydrogen-powered trains out there, such as the ones currently being rolled out in the German state of Lower Saxony. The technology made its debut there in 2018.</p><p>In the UK, a hydrogen locomotive, HydroFlex2, is undergoing testing in Long Marston, Warwickshire.</p><p>But current methods of storing hydrogen in tanks, as a highly pressurised gas or extremely cold (cryogenic) liquid, are expensive and potentially unsafe. Scientists have long aimed to find ways of storing hydrogen in more inert solid forms.</p><p>In H2M's case, the company has developed a nanomaterial within which hydrogen is stored at relatively low pressure compared to other techniques.</p><p>By simply opening a valve and lowering the pressure, the hydrogen comes off, just like when the CO2 in a carbonated drink gets released when you open the bottle, says Ms Quan.</p><p>She adds that hydrogen could be especially useful for powering heavy vehicles that go on long journeys, such as trains and lorries, though the company has also developed a hydrogen-powered three-wheeler tuk tuk as a small-scale demonstration.</p><p>\"Depending on the size of the fuel cell, we could give up to a week's worth of power,\" says Ms Quan of the tuk tuk.</p><p>But she adds that sourcing investment funds to develop her firm's technology has not been easy. And many other solid state hydrogen storage solutions are at an early phase of development.</p><p>Though some of them are exciting, the huge challenge they face is to prove that they are commercially viable and worth choosing over, say, batteries for certain applications.</p><p>Duncan Gregory at the University of Glasgow says that those working on hydrogen storage technology at the moment are aiming to achieve a density of 5 wt% (weight per cent) or greater within the storage medium. \"It's really difficult to get to that,\" he explains.</p><p>There's plenty of effort, though. Take the method that Ian Chen at Deakin University in Australia and colleagues are currently beavering away on.</p><p>It involves a technique called ball milling, a sort of grinding process using tiny balls inside a canister. This grinding activity raises pressure levels, encouraging gases to become absorbed by a powder inside the canister.</p><p>Prof Chen and his colleagues have found that they can use this to store gases including hydrogen in boron nitride powder.</p><p>\"We like it because it's stable, it's not toxic, it's lightweight,\" says Prof Chen, who adds that 5 wt% should be possible with this method.</p><p>In July, the team described how this process could be used to store hydrocarbons in an academic paper. The detail of experiments in which they managed to store hydrogen and other gases such as CO2 and ammonia are yet to be made public.</p><p>Prof Chen is enthused by the possibility of storing hydrogen in this form, which simply requires the application of heat to release the gas again. But he admits that a long road lies between this research and commercial success.</p><p>More technology of business:</p><p>The team would need to design large-scale equipment and show that the method would be truly cost-effective at scale. \"We don't claim that we have solved all the major problems,\" says Prof Chen.</p><p>The cost challenges were underlined in October when the German state of Baden-Württemberg ruled out replacing diesel locomotives with hydrogen-powered trains.</p><p>A study commissioned by the state concluded that the installation of overhead electricity lines or battery hybrid trains provided much better value for money over a 30-year period.</p><p>Prof Gregory, who is currently working with a separate, undisclosed firm on hydrogen technology, adds that one of the potential issues with the ball milling process is how long it takes. The small-scale experiments reported by Prof Chen and his colleagues so far took 20 hours of milling.</p><p>Besides transportation, hydrogen stored in a solid state could have other uses. A trial currently under way in Scotland will test hydrogen generation and storage on one of the Orkney Islands</p><p>A machine-learning system will monitor weather patterns and decide when to use electricity from nearby wind turbines to power the electrolysis process, which is how hydrogen is extracted from water.</p><p>\"It's a good test bed,\" says Enass Abo-Hamed, chief executive and co-founder of H2GO Power. \"You could have a week full of wind and then a week with nothing.\"</p><p>The system will also determine when the hydrogen would best be released or stored, in this case within a powder-like substance. This stored energy would provide a potential resource during wind droughts.</p><p>A lack of wind has, unfortunately, helped to push up UK energy prices this year.</p><p>Although it's not yet certain that the system on Orkney will actually be connected to the local grid during the trial, Dr Abo-Hamed says it is a possibility and, if so, the hydrogen could be used to power up to 70 homes. In the future it could also, in theory, be converted back into a gas state and used for domestic heating.</p><p>Hydrogen has potential as a boiler fuel that would be cleaner than natural gas, argues Prof Gregory, though there are significant challenges in implementing this, too.</p><p>Recent studies have cast doubt on hydrogen's potential as a fuel, both in terms of heating and transportation.</p><p>Prof Gregory argues that, if someone can crack the hydrogen storage problem, then that could fundamentally change how we power the world's vehicles - from freight trains to cars.</p><p>\"I can see in 20 years' time or whatever, when somebody eventually comes up with a material that will do this job, I reckon batteries could well be superseded by hydrogen,\" he says.</p>",

In addition to Twitter, the 37-year-old worked at Microsoft, Yahoo, Snap and Facebook in the past.</p><p>Ms Ramamurthy, meanwhile, worked at Facebook and Netflix before starting two of her own companies.</p><p>Together, they have been described as a well-connected \"tech power couple\".</p><p>Mr Krishnan was born in the southern Indian city of Chennai in what he described as a \"very traditional\" middle-income household.</p><p>His life changed when he convinced his father to buy him a computer - a luxury in the late 1990s.</p><p>\"It cost about 60,000-70,000 rupees [$730-840; £638-744], a large part of my father's pay check,\" he told Ms Mogilko in the 2021 interview. \"I told him I would use it for my studies.\"</p><p>But he still did not have internet because a dial-up connection was expensive and unaffordable.</p><p>So he would buy coding books instead to teach himself the basics, and practise every night.</p><p>Mr Krishnan met Ms Ramamurthy online in 2002 while studying engineering at Anna University in Chennai. By then, he was already on the path to becoming a software engineer. So was Ms Ramamurthy, a student in the same college.</p><p>\"A mutual friend wanted to start a coding project, so he decided to get the two nerdiest people he knew - me and Aarthi - on board,\" he told Ms Mogilko.</p><p>The collaboration did not survive, but his and Ms Ramamurthy's relationship did. The couple continued to chat on Yahoo messenger for a year until they finally met in person.</p><p>In the months to come, the internet continued to be the foundation of their relationship as they \"idealised the myth of Silicon Valley\" as the future of American endeavour, and dreamed of being there someday.</p><p>\"One of our first dates was watching bit-torrent copy of a 1999 Silicon Valley film in my tiny room,\" Mr Krishnan said in the interview.</p><p>Their big break came a few months later when one of Mr Krishnan's blog posts on Microsoft was noticed by a company executive, who then hired the couple in 2005.</p><p>In 2007, Mr Krishnan moved to the US and Ms Ramamurthy joined him six months later.</p><p>Mr Krishnan has said in the past that it took them a while to get used to living there, but work continued to be their solace.</p><p>After working at Microsoft, the couple moved on to other big tech companies. They got American citizenship in 2017, a moment Mr Krishnan has described in interviews as being on a par with their wedding and the birth of their first daughter.</p><p>Last December, they started their career as podcasters - a decision born out of pandemic-fuelled boredom, Mr Krishnan has explained in the past.</p><p>So, they decided to get on to Clubhouse, which became popular during the pandemic, to have conversations about the tech space.</p><p>The interviews are woven with analysis and candid repartee with experts, including the likes of Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and the late fashion designer Virgil Aboh.</p><p>While little is known about Mr Krishnan's ties with Mr Musk, he has been an open admirer of the billionaire in the past, describing him as an \"inspirational person and an iconic founder\".</p><p>He has also openly supported Mr Musk's vision for Twitter and criticised practices such as de-platforming on the microblogging website.</p><p>\"Having extrajudicial internet cops that lead to enforcement on your platform is the road to dystopian authoritarianism,\" he wrote on Twitter last month.</p><p>There's speculation that Mr Musk might have got Mr Krishnan - a cryptocurrency expert - on board to integrate his dogecoin with Twitter.</p><p>Whether Mr Krishnan will become the next \"Technoking\" (Mr Musk's alternative title for CEO) of Twitter or not, interesting times lie ahead for the social platform - and Mr Krishnan could be right in the middle of it.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Last month police said they made one of the largest seizures of 3D printed firearm components in the UK.</p><p>Officers from the Metropolitan Police's Specialist Crime Command had discovered what they alleged was a \"suspected makeshift 3D firearms factory\" at a home in London on 7 October.</p><p>Officers said it demonstrated how \"the emerging threat of 3D firearms continues to evolve\".</p><p>The discovery comes as some experts also warn of a growing threat.</p><p>Early versions of 3D printed guns were unreliable, single-shot weapons. Now the National Crime Agency (NCA) tells the BBC the guns are \"credible and viable\".</p><p>The NCA's Matthew Perfect, head of the the National Firearms Targeting Centre, says the latest 3D weapons are \"stuff that you definitely, definitely wouldn't want to see on the streets in the UK\".</p><p>\"These are automatic weapons. These are weapons that are capable of multiple rounds of discharge,\" he said.</p><p>At present, the 3D printed components only form some of the parts needed to make a gun, at most 80 to 90% of the weapon, Mr Perfect says.</p><p>Key metal components such as the barrel typically have to be manufactured in more traditional ways. And the guns still require ammunition.</p><p>As a consequence Mr Perfect is confident the guns can still be detected by \"normal security processes\".</p><p>But these firearms are hard to trace as they are made without serial numbers.</p><p>Police are seizing 3D printed weapons in greater numbers. From the start of last year there have been 21 recoveries of weapons, a \"significant increase\" on previous years, though still small compared to conventional weapons, Mr Perfect says.</p><p>Difficulties in transporting weapons across borders during the coronavirus pandemic may have contributed criminals' interest in printed guns, he suggests.</p><p>Peter Squires, professor of criminology and public policy at the University of Brighton, said the threat was likely to grow.</p><p>\"Things have moved quite fast,\" he told the BBC, adding the pace is only a little over expectations.</p><p>\"I'd certainly anticipate more of this, the technology is out there ... and the software and designs are available on the web.\"</p><p>And even if some of the \"plastic-type\" guns he says remain relatively unreliable, they still have the power to intimidate; guns, he notes, are only fired in about 20% of gun crimes.</p><p>Rajan Basra, senior research fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King's College London, says the situation in the UK mirrors a trend visible around Europe.</p><p>While most violent extremists will prefer established weapons, printed guns are an alternative for those who can't obtain illicit firearms.</p><p>\"We've seen a steady succession of extremists looking to either make 3D printed guns or even use them themselves,\" he said.</p><p>\"We've seen cases in Spain, Sweden, Germany, in the Netherlands, and several here in in the UK.\"</p><p>He said the clear majority of these cases involved members of far-right groups. Other terrorists groups seem less interested in the technology.</p><p>In part, Dr Basra suggests, that is because discussions on far-right extremist forums and communities sometimes included instructions on how to produce 3D printed weapons.</p><p>In June, members of an extreme right-wing terror group were convicted at Sheffield Crown Court. It was revealed police had found a partially constructed 3D printed firearm in the home of two members of the group.</p><p>Dr Basra warns the weapons are \"moving into the mainstream\" and on to mainstream internet platforms.</p><p>The emergence of new automatic weapons much more powerful than early single-shot designs has also increased their attractiveness.</p><p>Among extremists, he said, experts saw recurrent references to one semi-automatic model, the FGC - the name is an acronym expressing, in strong language, opposition to gun control.</p><p>\"It's a specific gun that was designed to be used with parts that aren't regulated in the EU,\" Dr Basra said.</p><p>The weapon was posted online in spring 2020 with step-by-step instructions. It comes with an over 100-page manual, and videos on how to go through each step of the process of manufacture, Dr Basra added.</p><p>Mr Perfect, from the NCA, says modified versions of the gun can be \"as good as any automatic firearm that you would buy from a reliable manufacturer\".</p><p>But police are keen to stress that gun violence in the UK is still relatively uncommon - about 35 homicides a year Mr Perfect estimates.</p><p>And use of an automatic weapon would attract a lot of police attention. But criminals want these weapons to intimidate other criminals.</p><p>For that they need a credible weapon, and 3D guns are now earning that credibility, due to better designs, and better printing technology - technology that is changing and improving all the time.</p><p>Christian Goblas, a ballistics expert at France's University of Rouen, recently told Euractiv \"3D metallic printing\" could become affordable in the next decade, which could make self-made weapons more durable and reliable.</p><p>And Europol told the BBC that national authorities within the EU have uncovered a number of cases of the production, sale and possession of 3D printed weapons and parts.</p><p>Some of the weapons and components were offered on illicit dark web marketplaces, which Europol said showed the synergies between the firearms trade and cybercrime.</p><p>The organisation noted that while producing a complete 3D printed firearm was still challenging \"rapidly evolving advanced technology may cause this to emerge as a more significant threat in the near future.\"</p><p>But Dr Basra warns of another risk. Terrorists have a history of copying methods that have previously been shown to be effective. He said there was a rise in terror attacks where a vehicle was driven into crowds after the 2016 Nice attack.</p><p>He says if 3D printed weapons are used in an attack that causes mass casualties, that would in turn send a message that \"3D printed guns are viable, and they're effective\".</p>",

Additional benefits will also include continuing to provide family health insurance for six months.</p><p>Support outside the US will be similar, but there will be a separate redundancy process to take into account local employment laws.</p><p>Meta's European headquarters are based in Dublin, where according to local reports it directly employs 3,000 people and many more contractors.</p><p>According to a Companies House filing, Meta employed more than 5,000 people in the UK as of December 2021.</p><p>But Meta has so far declined to release the number of redundancies it will make in either country.</p><p>Kevin Poulter, an employment lawyer at Freeths, said it was important Meta followed UK laws on redundancies.</p><p>He told the BBC that confidence in the tech job market and the opportunity to move freely and easily between established and start-up companies \"had been diminished if not wholly undermined within a week\".</p><p>He warned that \"if the leading lights of Twitter and Meta are now approaching the future cautiously, others are likely to follow\".</p><p>It's the second round of big tech lay-offs in a week - but the tone of Meta's statement was very different to Elon Musk's bullish defence of his decision to cut half of Twitter's workforce on Friday.</p><p>While Mr Musk took to Twitter to say the firm had no choice because it was losing millions of dollars every day, Mark Zuckerberg's statement was very contrite. He took responsibility, he said, and he was sorry.</p><p>If you know Mr Zuckerberg you will know this is uncharacteristic - he is not renowned for being a \"people person\" and his fixation is usually on work. He no longer has his former chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg beside him to help smooth the waters.</p><p>He is literally betting his own bottom dollar, as well as that of his company, on the creation of the metaverse - a virtual world in which he believes we will all spend our work and play time in the future.</p><p>It could be five or 10 years before this comes to fruition. If he holds his nerve and he is right, Meta will bounce back and, he hopes, become king of the new internet generation.</p><p>The plans for job cuts follow difficulties across the tech sector as the industry contends with slowing global economic growth.</p><p>Silicon Valley firms Stripe and Lyft recently announced large-scale lay-offs, while Amazon said it would freeze hiring in its corporate offices.</p><p>The bulk of Meta's $27.7bn (£24.3bn) revenue comes from advertising, but in difficult economic conditions many firms are cutting ad budgets.</p><p>Michael Malone, a veteran tech journalist based in Silicon Valley, told the BBC the industry was facing the \"triple whammy\" of a slowing economy, inflation and an end to pandemic-driven growth.</p><p>\"No-one's come up with a really great product, new product in the last few years,\" he said.</p><p>\"The possibility was going to be Facebook's Metaverse. But it's not taking off and it's draining an enormous amount of money.</p><p>\"So the fate of Facebook, I think, is up in the air.\"</p><p>Mr Malone said he was confident this was not the end for Silicon Valley though.</p><p>\"I've declared Silicon Valley dead about 10 times in my 30 years' reporting.\"</p><p>But with the start-up scene still appearing strong, he added: \"I won't write the Valley off yet.\"</p>",

Court documents in California say he played a key role in the scheme, playing \"the roles of bank officials and creating a bogus website\".</p><p>He also admitted to \"several other cyber and business email compromise schemes that cumulatively caused more than $24 million in losses\", the US justice department said.</p><p>Among them was a 2019 scheme, which plunged the European island of Malta into chaos as payment systems shut down after he tried to launder €13m ($13m) stolen by a gang of North Korean hackers from the Maltese Bank of Valletta.</p><p>At one point on Instagram, Abbas said he was a real estate developer and had a category of videos called \"Flexing\" - social media lingo for showing off.</p><p>In 2020, he renewed his lease for another year at the exclusive Palazzo Versace apartments in Dubai under his real name and phone number.</p><p>\"Thank you, Lord, for the many blessings in my life.

He also said he had only made $300,000 from the crime he was being tried for.</p><p>However, he was still sentenced to 135 months in a federal prison.</p>",

Investor confidence was hit by the news that Binance had scrapped its deal to buy FTX, citing concerns over due diligence.</p><p>There are also fears of further crypto market volatility if FTX goes bust.</p><p>Concerns about the company's financial health reportedly triggered $6bn (£5.2bn) of withdrawals in just three days.</p><p>\"I thought FTX was safe\", another customer told the BBC earlier on Thursday.</p><p>\"I've got about $3,000 (£2,630) worth of coins in my own crypto wallet but more worrying is that I invested $33,000 (£28,900) for my mum and stepdad through the app. I don't yet have the heart to tell them what's happened.\"</p><p>Binance said reports of \"mishandled customer funds and alleged US agency investigations\" had swayed its decision not to buy FTX.</p><p>The Reuters news agency reported that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was investigating FTX's handling of customer funds and its crypto-lending activities.</p><p>The markets regulator is also examining whether the platform has broken laws with regards to how it has handled customer assets.</p><p>Binance said in a statement posted on Twitter that the issues facing FTX were \"beyond our control or ability to help\".</p><p>\"Every time a major player in an industry fails, retail consumers will suffer. We have seen over the last several years that the crypto ecosystem is becoming more resilient and we believe in time that outliers that misuse user funds will be weeded out by the free market.\"</p><p>FTX's founder Sam Bankman-Fried and Binance's chief executive Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao are two of the most powerful people in the cryptocurrency market and high-profile rivals.</p><p>The pressure on FTX came in part from Mr Zhao, who had tweeted on Sunday that Binance would sell its holdings of FTX's digital token, known as FTT. The token has lost around 90% of its value this week.</p><p>Binance stepped in on Tuesday, saying it had signed a letter of intent to buy FTX's non-US unit. But it added it had \"the discretion to pull out from the deal at any time\".</p><p>Mr Zhao tweeted on Wednesday: \"Sad day. Tried, but [crying emoji]\".</p><p>As well as Bitcoin dropping on the news, shares in the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase fell by more than 9.5%.</p><p>Meanwhile, venture capital firm Sequoia Capital said it will completely write off its more than $210m investment in FTX, as the cryptocurrency exchange is at risk of bankruptcy.</p><p>\"Based on our current understanding, we are marking our investment down to $0,\" the company said in a statement posted on Twitter.</p><p>April Joyner, a correspondent at Business Insider in New York, told the BBC's Today programme the problems at FTX could be quite serious.</p><p>\"If FTX were to go under a lot of people could potentially lose their money depending on what's going on there,\" she said.</p><p>A notice on its website still reads: \"FTX is currently unable to process withdrawals. We strongly advise against depositing.\"</p><p>FTX was approached by BBC News for comment.</p><p>\"It's also led to a lot of turmoil on crypto markets - we've seen prices of Bitcoin, Etherium etc fall and so there's a lot of distress and worries about the crypto markets right now,\" Ms Joyner added.</p><p>Ms Joyner said the \"different players\" in cryptocurrency firms were \"very enmeshed\" with each other which meant \"if one entity has some sort of weakness it can bring down a lot of other players\".</p><p>There is a growing list of cryptocurrency businesses that have failed because of a lack of cash reserves.</p><p>Adding to the pressure, the SEC and other regulators have been ratcheting up scrutiny of the industry as concerns grow about how crypto platforms are trading.</p><p>Earlier this year, a subsidiary of crypto firm BlockFi agreed to pay a record penalty to settle charges related to its retail lending product.</p>",

It runs the country's largest search engine and presents itself as independent of the authorities.</p><p>According to the company's own statistics, it handles about 60% of web searches done in Russia - with Google responsible for about 35%.</p><p>From the start of the war, Yandex faced criticism for the pro-Kremlin slant of the sites and stories featured on its news aggregator, Yandex News. In September, it sold Yandex News to the Kremlin-linked owner of social network VK.</p><p>But Yandex retains control of its general search engine, and here, the results of BBC Monitoring's experiment reveal an alternative reality dominated by Russian propaganda about the war.</p><p>One topic searched for was Bucha, the Ukrainian town where hundreds of civilians were killed by Russian troops before they withdrew in early April.</p><p>The deaths shocked the world, but in Russia, many seem to believe the state media line that they were staged by Ukraine.</p><p>When we searched for Bucha on Yandex - using a VPN as if based in Russia and typing in Russian - the top page of results made it look like the killings had never taken place.</p><p>Three of the nine top results were anonymous blog posts denying the involvement of Russian troops. The remaining six contained no independent reporting of the events.</p><p>The discovery of mass burial sites in October in the town of Lyman, after it was retaken from Russian forces, was also reflected on Yandex from a pro-Kremlin viewpoint. Several pro-Kremlin news stories blaming the deaths on Ukrainian \"Nazis\" were in the top 10 results.</p><p>Searching for \"Ukraine\" on the search engine in the same way also produced results heavily slanted towards the Kremlin's narrative.</p><p>Four of the nine first-page results linked to pro-Kremlin news outlets, and none to independent media.</p><p>Glimpses of independent reporting only occasionally appeared in Yandex search results with links to Wikipedia articles or YouTube.</p><p>Asked to comment by the BBC, Yandex said its search in Russia \"displays content [that is] available on the internet, excluding sites which are blocked by the [media] regulator\". It denied there was any \"human interference\" in ranking results.</p><p>So what happens if you switch from Yandex to Russia's second-largest search engine, Google?</p><p>Searching on the US-based company's search engine with our VPN set to a Russian location, and typing in Russian, still brought up pro-Kremlin media outlets, but mixed with some independent and Western sources.</p><p>Even more independent sources appeared when we searched Google with the VPN set as though we were in the UK, although still typing in Russian. There were plenty of results covering either the civilian deaths or the war.</p><p>Google told the BBC that its search \"reflects the content that is available on the open web\", and its algorithm is trained to \"prominently surface high quality information from reliable sources\".</p><p>So why did Yandex's search results differ so much from Google's?</p><p>Several specialists the BBC spoke to said they believed it was unlikely that large-scale manipulation was taking place from inside Yandex, as this would be too complicated to do.</p><p>One possibility is that the company's results are simply being skewed by the Kremlin's crackdown on independent reporting of the invasion.</p><p>Because thousands of websites have been blocked by Russia's media regulator, huge swathes of information do not appear in Yandex's search results.</p><p>\"They [the authorities] can cleanse the results completely,\" Alexei Sokirko, a former Yandex developer, told the BBC.</p><p>At the same time, the Kremlin is spending heavily to make sure web content is created reflecting its own worldview, he added.</p><p>Search experts Guido Ampollini and Mykhailo Orlov, from the marketing firm GA Agency, say this will also potentially skew the results users see in Yandex, as the search engine's algorithm may reward pro-Kremlin material with higher rankings and down-rank alternative views.</p><p>Could using a VPN help Russians find out more about the war in their own language?</p><p>If they are using Yandex to find that information, then not necessarily.</p><p>When searching its engine with the VPN set to the UK and using Russian, the odd independent source appeared, but pro-Kremlin sources still dominated.</p><p>Mr Ampollini and Mr Orlov say the pro-Kremlin content appears carefully tailored to make the algorithm rank it higher.</p><p>And with one obscure news site that featured prominently in results, they also found signs of possible web traffic manipulation.</p><p>A large number of potentially artificial links to the site were found from external websites - a common technique to improve a site's search ranking.</p><p>Finally, Yandex may be reflecting the fact Russian users themselves are choosing pro-Kremlin content.</p><p>Search specialist Nick Boyle, of digital marketing agency The Audit Lab, told the BBC that - unlike Google - Yandex takes into account user behaviour.</p><p>This means, for example, that a website's search ranking may be affected by the number of visits to it. Google says this is not the case for its search engine.</p><p>The GA Agency team thought it possible that many Russians are clicking on content that portrays their military positively, prompting Yandex's algorithm to reward it with higher rankings.</p><p>Lev Gershenzon believes that, no matter how the Kremlin's dominance of Yandex's search results has been achieved, it means that anyone wanting to question what they hear on state media will only get information confirming the official view.</p><p>\"You open the Yandex main page and you start [searching for the] Kremenchuk [attack] to receive some alternative picture from other sources, and all you get is that 'yeah ok, you're right, it's fake' - and that's it,\" he told the BBC. \"It's like a double punch.\"</p>",

And an online operation was launched in 2018.</p><p>Serving the South Asian diaspora in the East Midlands city and further afield, sales soared during the coronavirus pandemic, as customers sought more comfort food - the tastes that they or their forebears brought to the UK from countries including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.</p><p>Mrs Popat's son Shyam was put forward to speak to the BBC. \"My mum is widely known in the community as being the person that runs the business,\" he says.</p><p>\"And they all want to speak to her specifically to see if she can source particular things.\"</p><p>He adds that it's not just first generation immigrants, or those who have just moved to the UK recently, that make up the core customer base. Instead it is also the second generation, who might be buying food for their families, and increasingly online.</p><p>\"During the lockdowns the website was a total lifesaver, and now we're out of lockdown it has become a thriving arm of the business in itself,\" says Shyam Popat. \"Online sales now account for approximately one-quarter to one-third of the entire turnover of the business.\"</p><p>In addition to importing products from South Asia, the shop also buys from Kenya.</p><p>The boost that the world's diasporas give to trade between countries is difficult to quantify, but governments are increasingly aware of the economic importance of migrant populations and their descendants.</p><p>Kenya announced in September that it would be creating a new ministry for Kenyans living abroad, and US President Joe Biden has announced that he will tell next month's US-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington that he wishes to \"amplify diaspora ties\".</p><p>But just how big are the world's diasporas? There are currently 281 million people who live in a country other than the one in which they were born, according to the 2022 World Migration Report from the United Nation's International Organization for Migration (IOM).</p><p>That number equates to 3.6% of the global population, or one in 30 people. And it doesn't include any children those people have that are born in their new country, nor does it include the descendants of former migrants.</p><p>For this reason, the IOM defines the terms \"migrants\" and \"diasporas\" (which comes from the Greek to scatter) separately. The later also including descendants of former migrants \"whose identity and sense of belonging, either real or symbolic, have been shaped by their migration experience and background\".</p><p>This equates to billions of people, but an exact number is very difficult to quantify given that it is determined by a person's cultural identity. Even the IOM said back in 2020 that \"currently there are no attempts to measure global diaspora populations per se\".</p><p>More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade.</p><p>What is certain, is that the entrepreneurial drive within migrant populations has long been recognised. A 2010 report by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said that immigrant entrepreneurs were better educated than their native counterparts, and more likely to create a new business.</p><p>And often those firms are involved in the importation of food, clothing or other goods from a migrant's former country, such as Indian-born Vijaya Popat and her thriving shop in Leicester. The store, and others like it, played their part in India's exports to the UK totalling $10.4bn last year.</p><p>Based in Paris, Olivier Habiyambere is helping to boost Kenyan exports to Europe. He is the founder of website Kenyan Diaspora Market, which imports food and clothing in bulk from the African country, and then sells it to customer across the European continent.</p><p>Mr Habiyambere, who was raised in Kenya, came up with the idea for the business when he moved to Paris to study and met others from Kenya and East Africa.</p><p>\"Everybody wanted Kenyan products, but the issue was bringing the products from Kenya to here,\" he says. \"People could pick up the products when they went to Kenya, but it's not like they could do that every year.\"</p><p>So he launched the business in April 2022 to offer Kenyans in Europe an easier way of buying products from home. Mr Habiyambere adds that business has grown steadily, helped by Kenyan communities spreading the word via WhatsApp groups.</p><p>While Kenyan Diaspora Market is focused on Kenyan migrants, Glasgow-based website Agora Greek Delicacies now has more non-Greek customers than those from within the UK's Greek communities.</p><p>It was set up a decade ago by husband and wife Christina Lyropoulou and Michael Sofianos, who had gone to university in the UK. They now employ 14 people and supply imported Greek food and drink to restaurants, cafes, individuals, and other businesses.</p><p>\"We started expanding to the British audience - so those travelling to Greece or had Greek friends,\" says Ms Lyropoulou. \"And our online shop saw an increase in sales of about 1000% in the first months of the lockdown.\"</p><p>Prof Pragya Agarwal, a behavioural and data scientist at the University of Loughborough, regularly buys products originating from her native India for herself and her family in the UK.</p><p>\"For me personally, it's about maintaining the connection with the motherland, the fatherland - whatever you call it,\" she says.</p><p>She laughs as she describes her love of Indian mangos, and admits she regularly would regularly order from a particular store online in a bid to get her mango fix, especially during the pandemic.</p><p>\"It's what I used to eat growing up in India every summer - every day after every meal.\"</p><p>Maria Elo, is an associate professor at the University of Southern Denmark who has a number of books and articles on diaspora and trade.</p><p>She says it's important to be aware of the framing that occurs whenever diaspora is discussed, with migrants often described in one of two ways.</p><p>One narrative is that migration and diaspora are problematic. Prof Elo describes that as a \"deficit view\" with negative connotations. But she adds there is also a positive narrative, which involves \"a big promise for business and economy\".</p><p>She adds that research shows that diaspora entrepreneurs are agile, and encourage cross-over products. \"We all eat pizza today, although we're not all Italians and that is something that crossed over a long time ago.\"</p>",

        "content": "<p>A few years ago, Dominic McCann realised that his smart thermostat was a treasure trove of data. So he decided to hack it, in order to track what his boiler was doing literally every minute of the day.</p><p>Using open source software, he accessed data from the thermostat online and plotted graphs that charted boiler activity against the changing temperature of a particular room. And when he upgraded the bi-folding door in his dining room to a triple-glazed model, the system instantly captured the difference that made.</p><p>\"I could quickly get a handle on, 'Oh, if I do this, I've saved this amount of energy,'\" he recalls. Insights like this helped him to save money, over time.</p><p>Mr McCann, who lives in Manchester, was aided by his technical background. He is director of Azymuth Acoustics UK, a noise assessment firm. When he first tinkered with his thermostat, back in 2019, he was arguably in a small minority.</p><p>But with rocketing energy prices, and the associated cost-of-living crisis, more people are turning to their smart thermostats seeking answers to the question: how do I reduce my energy bill?</p><p>Generally speaking, a smart thermostat is a connected version of a traditional central heating controller - one you can program and adjust via a smartphone or tablet app, or smart speaker.</p><p>Manufacturers have long touted these gadgets as money savers. Over the years, they have certainly provided increasingly detailed information about users' energy consumption and offered partially automated heating control.</p><p>And yet there is still debate over how beneficial smart thermostats are, with some research indicating that installing one doesn't always result in reduced energy use.</p><p>Google Nest, Honeywell, Drayton Wiser, Tado, Hive - all these brands say their systems make it easier to manage your heating. And many offer to learn how you heat your home, or detect when you're out, and respond automatically in an effort to curtail usage and save you money.</p><p>Mr McCann was arguably ahead of his time. In response to the cost-of-living crisis, smart thermostat maker Tado recently launched a software update that provides monthly bill predictions to help users keep within a budget. There are also room-by-room comparisons so people can see which rooms in their home require the most heating.</p><p>A spokesman for Tado says that the \"vast majority\" of its users are able to save money with its system.</p><p>There are more than 75 million smart thermostats installed worldwide and this number is expected to more than double by 2025, according to Neil Barbour, an industry analyst with S&P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p>He cites research from The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, which estimated that smart thermostats enable a roughly 10% reduction in home heating and cooling per household.</p><p>With that in mind, Mr Barbour and his colleagues have calculated that the US could reduce its total energy consumption by 45.4 terawatt hours - roughly the same amount of energy used by the entire state of Mississippi in 2020 - if every home with a heating, ventilation and cooling system installed a smart thermostat by 2026.</p><p>That would be quite a saving. But the research on how people actually use these devices paints a mixed picture. One study of Honeywell smart thermostat data from 1,379 households in California, published in September, found that users generally undid the benefits of the gadgets by manually overriding their scheduled programme of heating or cooling.</p><p>In other words, it was easy to boost the heating, for example, which meant some people eroded their energy savings.</p><p>However, a separate analysis published in 2020 of data from 20,000 Ecobee smart thermostats in the US found that users sometimes overrode their device's schedule in a way that used less energy. So manual interventions, overall, were not as costly as expected. The study was part-funded by Ecobee.</p><p>Smart thermostats may struggle when users expect them to do all the work for them, suggests the lead author of the second study, Brent Huchuk, who now works for tech firm PassiveLogic.</p><p>According to him, someone who is good at tweaking their own system is likely to do better than a smart thermostat.</p><p>\"It's pretty hard to beat someone who's actively managing [their] heating and cooling schedule,\" he says.</p><p>He also notes that the automatic interventions of smart thermostats will be limited when people work from home, since that reduces the number of opportunities the smart device has to shut the heating off.</p><p>There are also technical quirks to be aware of. In the UK, for instance, some highly energy efficient boilers on the market can modulate (adjust up or down) how much energy they use, in response to the amount of heating required.</p><p>But to take full advantage of this, you have to choose a smart thermostat that is fully compatible with your specific model of boiler. The Heating Hub, an independent consumer advice organisation, has published details about this online.</p><p>\"It's such a minefield for households,\" says founder Jo Alsop.</p><p>In the future, smart thermostats could theoretically track energy prices in real-time and allow people to heat their homes when it is cheapest to do so, suggests Dr Huchuk.</p><p>A 2017 study by Enrico Costanza at University College, London, and colleagues, experimented with exactly this idea. Participants received specially designed thermostats that displayed sample pricing data moment-by-moment.</p><p>That might be a little too much information for many. But the study suggested that, across multiple households, this could prompt a reduction in overall energy consumption.</p><p>Prof Costanza argues that, in reality, it would be more useful to give people information about their energy use over a longer period, say a month, or a forecast that explains how much someone could save by heating the house a little less in the morning, for example.</p><p>\"Making it easier for people to understand how they spend energy can make a difference,\" says Prof Costanza.</p><p>More technology of business:</p>",

It's not clear how soon they will be replaced, while the firm remains this unstable and sweeping job cuts have already been made.</p><p>From a security perspective, Twitter will, like all big platforms, be a constant target for hackers and bad actors around the world, meaning it cannot afford to take its eye off the ball and it must continue to ensure that its systems are robust, and threats are monitored.</p><p>As for users' privacy, you don't need me to tell you how important that is. And indeed, as we've seen, the US regulators are already keeping a very close eye on what's going on.</p><p>Elon Musk, on the other hand, says engagement and user numbers are higher than ever. We only have his word for it - I have to say that anecdotally I'm seeing plenty of Twitter Blue subscribers who seem happy with their new \"blue tick\". And however many of them there are, that's all fresh income that the firm did not previously have.</p><p>But it's also causing its own headache because now anybody can have a badge which until very recently was a symbol of authenticity - including fakes.</p><p>Musk has also said that bankruptcy is not out of the question. While it may feel like we are watching Twitter speeding towards the edge of a cliff, I think it's too early to tell whether it will manage to put the brakes on in time. In the early days of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg's motto was \"move fast and break things\" - Elon Musk appears to have taken this to another level.</p><p>The Twitter Blue subscription service allowed users to pay £6.99 ($7.99) per month for a blue tick. There would be a separate grey \"official\" badge for some high-profile accounts.</p><p>But on Wednesday Musk scrapped the new grey tick almost immediately, which added to the confusion.</p><p>However, on Friday new grey official badges for large organisations began reappearing on some Twitter profiles.</p><p>There has also been the emergence of fake accounts impersonating celebrities and politicians such as NBA star LeBron James and former UK prime minister Tony Blair.</p><p>US-based PR strategist Max Burns said he had seen fake accounts with the verified blue tick badge bought through Twitter Blue posing as support accounts for real airlines and asking customers who were trying to contact them on Twitter to direct message the fake accounts instead.</p><p>\"How long until a prankster takes a real passenger's ticket information and cancels their flight? Or takes their credit card info and goes on a spending spree?\" he said.</p><p>\"It will only take one major incident for every airline to bail on Twitter as a source of customer engagement.\"</p>",

        "content": "<p>Making a sequel to a title considered by many to be one of the best games of its generation must be daunting.</p><p>It was praised for its slick combat, emotional storytelling and immersive setting but 2018's God of War, which saw the return of iconic gaming character Kratos, did have a significant weakness according to one of the team making its successor.</p><p>\"It was apparent that the accessibility features needed to be better, 100%,\" says Mila Pavlin of Santa Monica Studios.</p><p>Mila and her team have been responsible for trying to make God of War: Ragnarok an experience that players can access more easily if they have a visual or hearing impairment or are unable to use a controller in a conventional way.</p><p>\"It was the biggest thing that we looked out for at the beginning of the process of making the game - how to make it more accessible to more people.</p><p>\"There were many gamers who wanted to play in 2018, but were unable to because of things like low vision, motor issues, cognitive or hearing disabilities. We wanted to make sure that everyone was included,\" Mila explains.</p><p>This approach hasn't been commonplace in the gaming sector. Mila's team were already working away on their plans when The Last of Us: Part 2 was released in 2020. It was widely praised for its approach to accessibility and opened up the conversation about the issue within the games industry.</p><p>Increasing the number of players able to engage with titles like this is a significant step for disabled gamers but also makes financial sense for big companies.</p><p>There are concerns that the games market, which was worth £7bn to the British economy in 2021, may stagnate in the coming months due to the cost of living crisis. Having a broader potential audience for your game is one way of encouraging growth.</p><p>Now Mila is hopeful that God of War: Ragnarok will set an example for the wider industry to follow.</p><p>Story-driven games like this often require intricate button combinations to progress and rely on sound or subtle visual cues to expose danger and opportunity to the player. It can make playing especially difficult for disabled people.</p><p>But small tweaks can make gaming more accessible, such as changing how captions read on the screen, giving players visual cues for sound and the option to fundamentally change how the controls work, allowing you to remove the need to press certain buttons and make movements, such as climbing, automatic.</p><p>\"We want to show that blockbuster games can open up their worlds to brand new players, making sure that players of all walks of life are able to play. The learning we have implemented, we want to spread across the industry to create more accessible games everywhere,\" says Mila.</p><p>\"Accessibility is not about diminishing the the original experience - we want to keep that experience together and intact. But ultimately, 10 years from now, I would love to see every triple A game have this level of accessibility options.\"</p><p>Video game accessibility critic and consultant Laura Dale says it's \"really heart-warming to see big companies in the industry finally starting to see disabled people as people who deserve to be able to play video games\".</p><p>Laura is autistic and dyspraxic, and as the presenter of the Access-Ability programme on YouTube, she reviews the accessibility options games offer people with a variety of disabilities - both visible and non-visible.</p><p>Having a big suite of options to help different players access games, she explains \"really is a new space and it's still a very positive surprise when you see a game go as far out of the way as God of War: Ragnarok does.</p><p>\"When I started making YouTube videos about accessibility and video games, there were basically no examples you could point to that were broadly accessible for most kinds of disabled gamers. The sheer difference between what came out four years ago and today, honestly it is night and day. I am really excited by the direction the industry is going in, and how quickly.</p><p>\"I think there is always room for improvement, I don't think we yet have a game that I can point to and say this one is perfect and does absolutely everything you could possibly do to make a video game accessible to every disabled player, but I think that we are getting closer.\"</p><p>The God of War series dates back to 2005 and follows the story of Greek god Kratos and the triumphs, tragedies and treachery he experiences. The 2018 release re-imagined the action-adventure series with a more mature Kratos struggling to cope with parenthood. It was a success, going on to win many prestigious awards.</p><p>Despite concerns that Ragnarok pushes older generation PlayStations to their limits in order to play, with some comparing the noise a PlayStation 4 makes while running the game like that of a jet engine taking off, its reviews scores suggest the sequel has more than lived up to expectations.</p><p>Simon Cardy is a senior editorial producer at IGN and reviewed God of War: Ragnarok for the site.</p><p>\"Some people might prefer the more focused nature of the 2018 release, as opposed to the broader more epic scale of this one,\" he explains.</p><p>\"Maybe there are a couple of little bits you could tighten here or there, but I think it's really nit-picking.\"</p><p>Simon gave the game 10 out of 10 and describes it as \"a masterpiece\".</p><p>\"It's like when Francis Ford Coppola was making the Godfather Part II. How do you follow up on the Godfather? Well he managed to do it by arguably, making an even better film, which is what I think Sony Santa Monica games studio have done here.\"</p><p>Wandering around a frozen landscape with a tempestuous teenager and a sarcastic severed head (it's based on Norse mythology after all) while battling monsters and gods may not be everyone's cup of tea. However, for fans of crafted single-player story experiences God of War: Ragnarok seems to have lived up to the high bar set by its predecessor.</p><p>Bigger doesn't automatically mean better in gaming and as Simon says, \"if anything it means more things can go wrong\" but he believes the studio \"have managed that balance between scope and the intimacy of the story elegantly\".</p><p>He goes on to argue that \"there's no other games studio that gets performances out of their actors like Sony Santa Monica at the moment in my opinion, it's a different level to almost every other game out there in terms of writing and acting\".</p><p>If you're a PS4 owner however, Simon recommends playing with your headphones on - just to hide the noise your machine will undoubtedly make.</p><p>More gaming content on Press X to Continue - the BBC Sounds gaming Podcast.</p>",

Additional benefits will also include continuing to provide family health insurance for six months.</p><p>Support outside the US will be similar, but there will be a separate redundancy process to take into account local employment laws.</p><p>Meta's European headquarters are based in Dublin, where according to local reports it directly employs 3,000 people and many more contractors.</p><p>According to a Companies House filing, Meta employed more than 5,000 people in the UK as of December 2021.</p><p>But Meta has so far declined to release the number of redundancies it will make in either country.</p><p>Kevin Poulter, an employment lawyer at Freeths, said it was important Meta followed UK laws on redundancies.</p><p>He told the BBC that confidence in the tech job market and the opportunity to move freely and easily between established and start-up companies \"had been diminished if not wholly undermined within a week\".</p><p>He warned that \"if the leading lights of Twitter and Meta are now approaching the future cautiously, others are likely to follow\".</p><p>It's the second round of big tech lay-offs in a week - but the tone of Meta's statement was very different to Elon Musk's bullish defence of his decision to cut half of Twitter's workforce on Friday.</p><p>While Mr Musk took to Twitter to say the firm had no choice because it was losing millions of dollars every day, Mark Zuckerberg's statement was very contrite. He took responsibility, he said, and he was sorry.</p><p>If you know Mr Zuckerberg you will know this is uncharacteristic - he is not renowned for being a \"people person\" and his fixation is usually on work. He no longer has his former chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg beside him to help smooth the waters.</p><p>He is literally betting his own bottom dollar, as well as that of his company, on the creation of the metaverse - a virtual world in which he believes we will all spend our work and play time in the future.</p><p>It could be five or 10 years before this comes to fruition. If he holds his nerve and he is right, Meta will bounce back and, he hopes, become king of the new internet generation.</p><p>The plans for job cuts follow difficulties across the tech sector as the industry contends with slowing global economic growth.</p><p>Silicon Valley firms Stripe and Lyft recently announced large-scale lay-offs, while Amazon said it would freeze hiring in its corporate offices.</p><p>The bulk of Meta's $27.7bn (£24.3bn) revenue comes from advertising, but in difficult economic conditions many firms are cutting ad budgets.</p><p>Michael Malone, a veteran tech journalist based in Silicon Valley, told the BBC the industry was facing the \"triple whammy\" of a slowing economy, inflation and an end to pandemic-driven growth.</p><p>\"No-one's come up with a really great product, new product in the last few years,\" he said.</p><p>\"The possibility was going to be Facebook's Metaverse. But it's not taking off and it's draining an enormous amount of money.</p><p>\"So the fate of Facebook, I think, is up in the air.\"</p><p>Mr Malone said he was confident this was not the end for Silicon Valley though.</p><p>\"I've declared Silicon Valley dead about 10 times in my 30 years' reporting.\"</p><p>But with the start-up scene still appearing strong, he added: \"I won't write the Valley off yet.\"</p>",

And it has installed about 1,000 of an earlier version of its robot arm to sort packages at locations in the US and Europe.</p><p>The robots the firm showcased on Thursday also remain in trial mode, though deployments are expected to become more widespread over the next two years.</p><p>The company said it hopes to deliver 500 million packages by drone annually by the end of the decade, including to densely populated areas like Seattle.</p><p>But that will still be a tiny part of the 5 billion packages the company says it currently handles each year.</p><p>Robotics has also not been immune to the firm's cost-cutting focus, as the company's sales have slowed and concerns about economic recession increase.</p><p>This year, Amazon closed its UK drone programme, and cancelled parts of its robotics operation, such as Scout, which was working on a machine that could deliver to people's homes.</p><p>\"We're totally aware of the macroeconomic conditions out there,\" Mr Brady said, noting that the company's hiring freeze applies to its robotics division. But he added, \"we're not going to ease up on investments\".</p>",

She adds that digital engagement \"helps authors build their brands, as well as finding other revenue generating activities\".</p><p>Jane Ostler is executive vice president of global thought leadership at brand consulting company Kantar. She sees online serialisation as an effective form of digital marketing, a way for new writers to get themselves better known. \"I think there is a lot of potential here for a new writer,\" she says.</p><p>While prolific Nottingham-based author Kristina Adams hasn't serialised any of her 16 self-published novels and three non-fiction titles, she has been sending free weekly digital newsletters about literature and life to subscribers since 2014. This was two years before the now 32-year-old released her first book.</p><p>She continues to send these emails out to more than 2,500 people via a service called MailerLite. They include stories about things referenced in her books, talks about her dog Millie, and promotion of upcoming releases.</p><p>\"Digital newsletters in particular, I think more than social media, really humanise you to your readers,\" says Ms Adams, who writes romance titles under her full name, and ghost stories as KC Adams. \"It gives you a much closer connection.</p><p>\"And sending out the newsletters really makes a different to sales. Every time I sent one out I get an up-turn in sales.</p><p>\"You can think that you are sending out far too many, but in most cases only about a fifth of people will open each email. So while you think you are shouting and demanding attention, most subscribers wouldn't see it that way.\"</p><p>Back in Salt Lake City, Ms Griffin is now serialising her second novel. She says she was inspired to release her book in instalments by 19th Century French writer Alexandre Dumas.</p><p>Like her, he wrote gothic fiction, and his well-known novel The Count of Monte Cristo was serialised in a Parisian weekly newspaper in the 1840s.</p><p>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.</p><p>As is the norm for Substack, people can read the chapters of Ms Griffin's novels for free via her page on the app and website.</p><p>However, paying subscribers get extra benefits, such as the ability to read Ms Griffin's commentaries, post their own thoughts, chat with other subscribers, and even write and publish their own essays.</p><p>Ms Griffin says all this feedback is very helpful.</p><p>\"Recently, two readers mentioned that they wished my chapters were longer, so I started making them longer,\" she says. \"I love being able to respond in real-time.\"</p><p>Ms Griffin adds that she had researched self-publishing her books in digital form via Amazon, but that her subscription model is far more lucrative.</p><p>She explains the maths. \"Say I sold 1,000 books on Amazon, then I'd make $1,000, maybe more, maybe $5,000.</p><p>\"But if I - instead of just selling it - adopted a subscription model, and charged readers $8 or $9 a month, then from the same 1,000 fans, I could presumably make $100,000 in salary.\"</p><p>She adds that with a traditional book deal she'd be even worse off financially, as she'd likely only get a royalty rate of around 15% of revenues.</p><p>In addition to the subscription payments, Ms Griffin's followers can pay to buy and download the digital artwork that she designs for each chapter.</p><p>\"I think the beauty of it [serialisation] is you can start grassroots, and start from the bottom,\" she says. \"I'm not Stephen King, I'm just barely getting started.\"</p><p>Additional reporting by Will Smale</p>",

And I think we are attracting new customers as a consequence of that.\"</p><p>Primark has also been upping its game at its biggest \"destination\" stores, like its vast Manchester city centre one, with cafes, a barber shop, a vintage concession store and pop-up space to personalise Primark products.</p><p>\"We are, I think, the new department store, because I think we offer something for everybody but done in a new and exciting way,\" Mr Marchant says.</p><p>And this now includes dipping its toe into the world of e-commerce.</p><p>Retail analyst Catherine Shuttleworth, CEO and founder of Savvy Marketing, says Primark is simply bowing to the inevitable.</p><p>\"They've had massive highly successful physical store growth, not just in the UK and Ireland, but also across the world. However, that dependency on a store-only format has its limitations as Primark found out to their cost in the retail lockdowns during the pandemic,\" she says.</p><p>An online presence not only allows them to reach shoppers who can't easily access a store, or don't have time to queue up so want flexibility in when and where they visit, she says click-and-collect may also become important for the hordes of Primark fans to get their hands on products quickly before they sell out.</p><p>Given the costs of fulfilling and delivering online orders, and dealing with high levels of returns, it can be hard for retailers to make the economics of e-commerce stack up.</p><p>\"Online is a huge commercial undertaking and the logistics for a business with the size and scale of Primark are enormous. Click-and-collect is the most sensible way to run this operation, not least because it allows returns to be placed back into the store stock to help keep costs down,\" Ms Shuttleworth says.</p>",

        "content": "<p>A wave of new paid blue tick accounts impersonating influential individuals and brands has led to chaos and confusion on Twitter.</p><p>Fake \"verified\" accounts in the names of politicians, celebrities, major organisations and businesses started appearing on the platform on Thursday.</p><p>Twitter suspended many of them, but the company's rapidly changing attempts to address the issue added to the confusion.</p><p>Experts had previously warned that the new Twitter Blue subscription service announced by new chief Elon Musk, which allows users to pay £6.99 ($7.99) per month for a blue tick, would be immediately exploited by bad actors and scammers, and erode trust in the platform.</p><p>The extent of the problem with new fake blue tick accounts was laid bare after the feature launched on Wednesday.</p><p>Blue tick versions of major brand accounts such as Apple, Nintendo, BP and Chiquita were suspended. Fake accounts posing as high-profile individuals like Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg, current and former US Presidents Joe Biden, Donald Trump and George W Bush, and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair were also removed.</p><p>In one case, an account in the name of Republican candidate for Arizona governor Kari Lake tweeted to announce she was conceding to her Democratic opponent, despite the fact votes are still being counted in the tight race. It took hours for Twitter to remove the tweet and the fake account.</p><p>A fake Tesla account, another company owned by Mr Musk, joked about 9/11, while Mr Musk himself was impersonated.</p><p>One of the most disruptive accounts impersonated US pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, and declared \"insulin is free now\".</p><p>The company had to distance itself from the fake announcement.</p><p>The paid blue tick system is also being exploited by conspiracy theorists and far-right activists.</p><p>The BBC has seen at least three well-known QAnon influencer accounts which have purchased blue ticks on Twitter.</p><p>Far-right activists Jason Kessler and Richard Spencer, who organised the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, have both purchased blue ticks.</p><p>Twitter had previously removed verification badges from the accounts of Mr Kessler and Mr Spencer after the violent rally five years ago.</p><p>Researchers also spotted a variety of accounts with purchased blue ticks using AI generated images of fake personalities. This is a specific area of concern as such inauthentic accounts are routinely used in influence operations, at times by foreign states with the aim of influencing political events in other countries.</p><p>Twitter suspended many of the imposter blue tick accounts, but at times struggled to keep up with the pace of new ones appearing.</p><p>New grey \"official\" badges were added under the handles of some high-profile accounts, before being scrapped by Mr Musk almost immediately.</p><p>However, on Friday new grey official badges began reappearing on some Twitter profiles.</p><p>And some users based in the US reported the Twitter Blue subscription system was no longer available to them.</p><p>Mr Musk himself initially said blue tick parody accounts of high-profile users would have to clarify that they are not genuine in their profile bios.</p><p>Later he declared the word parody would also need to be included in account names, adding that \"tricking people is not ok\".</p><p>As of now, it is still unclear how Mr Musk and his newly acquired platform plan to address the issue of blue tick impersonations in the long run.</p><p>While the issue of verified accounts temporarily changing their names in ways which might mislead had previously surfaced on the platform, such attempts were extremely rare.</p><p>Experts worry that the harm caused by a lack of trust in Twitter's verification system could come to the fore during events such as mass shootings, terrorist attacks or natural disasters, where Twitter is often used by local authorities, police, emergency services and journalists for accurate information and advice.</p><p>The BBC reached to Twitter for comment, but received no response.</p><p>By Marianna Spring, Disinformation and social media correspondent</p><p>A lot of the parody accounts springing up on Twitter right now might seem quite funny. But it's important to remember that when people don't know who and what to believe, it can pose serious risks.</p><p>Throughout the pandemic, recent conflicts and elections - we're reminded time and time again of the real-world harm that online mistruths can have.</p><p>Now, bad actors can use blue ticks to give the disinformation they promote an air of legitimacy - or to confuse users.</p><p>Blue ticks had become a handy tool to identify official accounts, so its unsurprising that - at least at first - this is causing chaos. Not least because it's happening at the same time as other chaotic changes.</p><p>Now that blue ticks may be rendered meaningless, users will instead have to rely on other tools to see if an account is really who they say they are.</p><p>Check out their other tweets, look at their followers - and search off Twitter or via official websites to follow links to genuine social media profiles.</p><p>Before, it felt like social media sites had woken up to the impact disinformation can have offline - and were at least starting to get to grips with it. This, though, feels like a step backwards - and there are fears there could be more.</p>",

        "content": "<p>It took fewer than eight days for Sam Bankman-Fried to go from being nicknamed the \"King Of Crypto\" to his company filing for bankruptcy and him stepping down as chief executive, facing federal investigations into how he handled the company's finances.</p><p>Over the last few years, the internet has been flooded with long interviews with him, speaking over video chat from his office desk in the Bahamas.</p><p>In some of them, there's a distracting clicking noise.</p><p>As his interviewees listen intently to his incredible story of how he became a multibillionaire in five years, the sound is persistent and clearly coming from the American entrepreneur's mouse.</p><p>\"Click, click, click,\" it goes, in rapid, on-off bursts.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mr Bankman-Fried's eyes dart around the screen.</p><p>It's not clear from the videos what he's doing on his computer, but his tweets can give us a pretty good clue.</p><p>\"I'm (in)famous for playing League of Legends while on phone calls,\" he tweeted in February 2021.</p><p>Mr Bankman-Fried - the former boss of embattled cryptocurrency exchange FTX - is an avid gamer. And in a series of tweets to his nearly one million followers, he explained why. Playing the team fantasy battle game was his way to get his mind to switch off from running two companies trading billions of dollars a day.</p><p>\"Some people drink too much; some gamble. I play League,\" he said.</p><p>Since the 30-year-old's cryptocurrency empire collapsed this week in dramatic fashion, another anecdote about his gaming has resurfaced online.</p><p>According to a blog post from venture capital giant Sequoia Capital, Mr Bankman-Fried played an intense League of Legends battle during a high-level video call with their investment team.</p><p>It didn't seem to put them off at all, though. The group proceeded to invest $210m in Mr Bankman-Fried's company FTX.</p><p>This week, Sequoia Capital deleted that gushing blog post and announced it is now writing off their FTX investment as a loss.</p><p>The firm is not the only investor to have lost eye-watering amounts of money since Mr Bankman-Fried's $32bn empire collapsed.</p><p>FTX had an estimated 1.2 million registered users who were using the exchange to buy cryptocurrency tokens such as Bitcoin and thousands of others.</p><p>From large traders to everyday crypto fans, many are left wondering if they will ever get back their savings trapped in FTX's digital wallets.</p><p>It's a dizzying downfall and the rise of Mr Bankman-Fried is also its own dramatic story of risks, rewards and beanbags.</p><p>Mr Bankman-Fried went to Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) - a prestigious US research university where he studied physics and maths.</p><p>But the young bright undergraduate says it was lessons learned in the student dorms that led him on his path to getting rich.</p><p>In a BBC radio interview last month, he recalled being swept up in the \"effective altruism\" movement. Effective altruism is a community of people \"trying to figure out what practical things you can do with your life to have as much positive impact as you can on the world\", he said.</p><p>So, as Mr Bankman-Fried recalls, he decided to get into banking to make as much money as he could to give it back to good causes.</p><p>He learned to trade stocks during a short stint at trading firm Jane Street in New York before he got bored and decided to experiment with Bitcoin.</p><p>He noticed the variations in the value of Bitcoin across different cryptocurrency exchanges and started arbitraging - buying Bitcoin from places selling it cheap and selling to other places where it was trading for more.</p><p>After a month of making modest profits, he got together with some college friends and started a trading business called Alameda Research.</p><p>Mr Bankman-Fried says it wasn't easy and took months of perfecting techniques about how to move money in and out of banks and across borders. But after around three months, he and his small team hit the jackpot.</p><p>\"We were super-dogged,\" he said to the Jax Jones and Martin Warner Show podcast a year ago. \"We just kept going. If someone throws another roadblock, we would be creative, and if our system couldn't handle that, we would just build a new system to get us through that hoop.\"</p><p>By January 2018, his team were making $1m every day.</p><p>A business reporter at CNBC asked him recently how that felt.</p><p>Intellectually and according to his methodology, he said, \"it made perfect\" sense. \"But viscerally, it surprised me every day,\" he said.</p><p>Sam Bankman-Fried became an official billionaire in 2021, thanks to his secondary and more high-profile business, FTX. The crypto exchange grew to be the second largest in the world and a titan of the industry, seeing $10-$15bn traded a day.</p><p>In early 2022, FTX was valued at $32bn and a household name, with an NBA stadium named after the company and endorsements from celebrity backers such as the NFL's Tom Brady.</p><p>All the while, Mr Bankman-Fried seemingly delighted in giving his Twitter followers an insight into his lifestyle. He mainly sleeps on a beanbag next to his desk in the office, he said, with a picture of him lying next to his staff at their trading terminals.</p><p>In another, he posted in the early hours of the morning. \"Couldn't sleep. Back to the office,\" he wrote.</p><p>Mr Bankman-Fried's dream of giving away vast amounts of money to charity was also well under way. In the BBC radio interview last month, he claimed he had given away \"a few hundred million as of now\".</p><p>And his generosity didn't just extend to charities. In the last six months, the \"King of Crypto\" was given another nickname - \"Crypto's White Knight\".</p><p>With the price of cryptocurrencies falling in 2022, the so-called \"Crypto Winter\" is in full swing. While other companies in the industry faltered, Mr Bankman-Fried was handing out bailout cash in the hundreds of millions.</p><p>Asked why he was trying to prop up failing crypto firms, he told CNBC: \"It's not going to be good long-term if we have real pain and real blow outs. And it's not fair to customers.\"</p><p>He also claimed, in the same interview, to have $2bn in reserve that he could use to help failing crypto companies.</p><p>But last week, he was going around the same industry himself, trying to raise money to save his own company and customers.</p><p>Questions about the real financial stability of FTX began swirling after an article on the CoinDesk website suggested that much of Mr Bankman-Fried's trading giant Alameda Research rests on a foundation largely made up of a coin that a sister company of FTX invented, not an independent asset.</p><p>Further accusations that Alameda Research used FTX's customer deposits as loans for trading were made in the Wall Street Journal.</p><p>The beginning of the end came though when FTX's main competitor - Binance - publicly sold off all its crypto tokens linked to FTX a few days later.</p><p>Binance chief executive Changpeng Zhao told his 7.5 million followers his company would be selling off the holdings \"in light of recent revelations\".</p><p>It sparked a run on FTX, with panicked customers withdrawing billions of dollars from the cryptocurrency exchange.</p><p>Withdrawals were halted and Mr Bankman-Fried tried to get a bailout, with Binance at one stage publicly considering a buyout before walking away.</p><p>Binance said reports of \"mishandled customer funds and alleged US agency investigations\" had swayed its decision.</p><p>A day later, FTX was declared bankrupt.</p><p>Mr Bankman-Fried apologised in a series of tweets saying: \"I'm really sorry, again, that we ended up here.</p><p>\"Hopefully things can find a way to recover. Hopefully this can bring some amount of transparency, trust and governance to them.\"</p><p>He also said he \"was shocked to see things unravel the way they did\".</p><p>So was, and is, the crypto world.

        "content": "<p>As a teenage music nerd, I would sit in my bedroom every Sunday afternoon, listening to Bruno Brookes count down the Top 40 and writing the results into a thick lever-arch file.</p><p>Somewhere in my parents' attic, those yellowing A4 sheets boast accolades from superstars like Madonna and Michael Jackson, alongside forgotten hits by Arnee And The Terminators or Twenty4Seven ft Captain Hollywood (I Can't Stand It, number seven on 6 October 1990).</p><p>Back then, the charts were entering their middle age. There had been a big fuss on Top Of The Pops when T'Pau scored the UK's 600th number one with China In Your Hand. And the chart's inherent ranking system (\"my favourite band is officially better than yours\") led to a lifelong obsession.</p><p>This week, the charts celebrate their 70th birthday, with Taylor Swift's Anti-Hero the current chart-topper (number 1,404, fact fans).</p><p>Their significance has diminished in the streaming era - but every so often, a story breaks into the public consciousness, whether it is LadBaby scoring a record-breaking fourth Christmas number one; or the incredible resurgence of Kate Bush's Running Up That Hill.</p><p>But seven decades of chart history have not passed without incident. Here are seven controversies that made headlines over the years.</p><p>The singles chart began in 1952, when Percy Dickins, one of the founders of the New Musical Express, decided to produce a ranked list of the UK's best-selling singles, by telephoning 20 record shops up and down the country every week and asking what they had sold.</p><p>The first ever Top 12 was published in the NME on 14 November, with Al Martino's schmaltzy ballad Here In My Heart at number one.</p><p>Pretty soon, rival publications wanted a piece of the action. Record Mirror started its top 10 in 1955, based on postal returns from record stores, Another magazine, Melody Maker, started its chart in 1956, and was the first to include sales from Northern Ireland.</p><p>Then, in 1960, the music industry trade paper Record Retailer (now called Music Week) launched what is now recognised as the \"official\" chart, based on reports from a panel of 30 shops. But for almost a decade, those charts were only available to industry insiders, which led to one of the biggest chart anomalies of all time.</p><p>In 1962, the Beatles cut their breakthrough single Please, Please Me at Abbey Road studios. When they finished the 18th, and final, take, producer George Martin said: \"Gentlemen, you have just made your first number one record.\"</p><p>And he was right - but only if you read the NME, Melody Maker, or Record Mirror. In the \"official\" chart, Please, Please Me was denied the top spot by yodelling crooner Frank Ifield and his song Wayward Wind.</p><p>As the Record Retailer chart is now recognised as canon, The Beatles' historic run of 17 number one singles officially begins with From Me To You.</p><p>In the wake of Margaret Thatcher's death in 2013, the song Ding! Dong! The Witch is Dead, from the Wizard Of Oz soundtrack, was downloaded enough times to reach number two.</p><p>In doing so, it became engulfed in a storm of controversy, not least at the BBC. Rather than playing the song in full during the Official Chart show, Radio 1 played a report from Newsbeat explaining the song's significance.</p><p>\"I don't believe it's a shoddy compromise but it is a compromise,\" then-Radio 1 controller Ben Cooper told BBC 5 Live when asked to defend the decision.</p><p>\"You have got a record which is not a political record. It is actually a personal attack on someone. There is a grieving family here and they are yet to bury their loved one and... I need to take that into account.</p><p>\"But I am very much aware that, on the other side of the issue, if I ban that record, then there are questions about freedom of speech and about censorship.</p><p>\"So yes, I have compromised, but I believe it is the most logical compromise available to me.\"</p><p>Although the first singles chart was supposed to be a Top 12, it actually featured 15 songs, thanks to ties in 7th, 8th and 11th places.</p><p>But ties are pretty rare - and they have only caused a major controversy once in the chart's 70-year history.</p><p>In 1990, the two songs at the top of the charts achieved exactly the same number of sales. One was Steve Miller's 1972 rock smash The Joker, enjoying a revival thanks to its use in a Levi's commercial. The other was Deee-Lite's Groove Is In The Heart, a giddily playful wedding disco classic.</p><p>To much wringing of hands, the older song was given the number one spot - and John Pinder, chart manager for polling company Gallup, was wheeled out to explain why</p><p>\"A ruling was established in 1973 by the British Phonographic Industry that there are no equal positions in the charts,\" he said. \"The guidelines recommend that the preferred single is the one that has increased its sales most in the course of the week.\"</p><p>According to Pinder, The Joker's sales had gone up by 57%, and Deee-Lite's increase was only 37%.</p><p>But Deee-Lite's record label still were not happy - protesting that their brand new signing would benefit more from the publicity of scoring a number one single.</p><p>Their protest deflated, however, when it transpired The Joker had actually sold eight more copies than Groove Is In The Heart - 44,118 to 44,110 (a rounding error initially obscured the discrepancy).</p><p>In 1991, the rules were changed to allow ties again - such as when The Prodigy's Out Of Space shared 19th place with Lisa Stansfield's Some Day I'm Coming Back in January 1993 - but they are still uncommon.</p><p>As you would imagine, getting songs into the chart is pretty important to record labels; and sometimes the general public cannot be trusted to have good taste. So, at various points over the years, people have invested in alternative methods of cracking the Top 40.</p><p>In 1978, the Mirror newspaper uncovered evidence that a network of housewives was being paid to go into record shops and buy multiple copies of songs like Sweet Sweet Smile by The Carpenters, or Right Time Of The Night by Jennifer Warnes.</p><p>\"It is very important that you appear to be a normal customer making a genuine purchase,\" the record buyers were told. \"Please do not quote the [catalogue] number of the record when asking for it.\"</p><p>Cunningly, the idea was to help songs into the lower reaches of the chart, after which, the Mirror reported: \"Natural, genuine sales will take over as the record gets the exposure on radio and television that follows automatically once it is established in the top 50.\"</p><p>The paper's expose ended that particular scheme - but two years later, labels were at it again.</p><p>Two separate documentaries, one by BBC Two's Newsnight and the other by ITV's World In Action, claimed record stores were being sent free gifts to encourage them to falsify chart reports for acts like Fleetwood Mac, Gary Numan, Queen and The Pretenders.</p><p>One owner told World In Action they received items, including T-shirts and alcohol, worth as much as £237 in a single week (£911 in 2022 terms).</p><p>Sometimes, record companies would even send over free copies of songs they wanted to chart. It was claimed that this resulted in a band called Shy earning a Top 75 single, despite retailers only ordering 82 copies of the song.</p><p>The programmes led to a six-week investigation by the British record industry which found \"a very thin dividing line between what is known as aggressive marketing and what is known as hyping\".</p><p>It said that, while the practice was not widespread, some shops had received a \"supply of promotional records\" and \"other unrelated material\" in an effort to persuade owners to cook the books; and recommended that record label staff were no longer paid bonuses based on chart positions.</p><p>Piracy plagued the music industry in the 2000s, as sites like Napster and Kazaa made millions of songs available for free, albeit illegally.</p><p>In the space of a decade, global recorded music revenues plummeted from $23.4bn (£20bn) in 2001 to $15.6bn (£13bn) in 2010.</p><p>The singles market was particularly badly hit, reaching a low point in March 2006, when US band Orson managed to top the charts with just 17,694 sales of their pop-rock radio hit No Tomorrow.</p><p>Analysts speculated that it signalled the death of the single as a consumer format.</p><p>Orson never reached the top 10 again, and split up in 2007. But band members George Astasio and Jason Pebworth have subsequently scored huge hits as writers for DJ Fresh (Hot Right Now), Iggy Azalea (Fancy) and Bebe Rexha (No Broken Hearts).</p><p>Elton John holds the record for the UK's best-selling number one single. His Princess Diana tribute Candle In The Wind 1997 sold 1.5 million copies in its first week of release, and went on to triple that figure.</p><p>The advent of streaming changed the charts forever. No longer did the Top 40 reflect the songs people were buying. Instead, it told you what they were listening to.</p><p>In many ways, this was a blessing. It certainly broke the X Factor's stranglehold on the number one spot, because people generally bought the winners' singles as a souvenir, rarely listening to the musical monstrosities they contained (there is a reason why Little Mix airbrushed Cannonball from their official discography).</p><p>But the popularity of streaming also broke the charts in new, unique ways.</p><p>For one week in March 2017, Ed Sheeran had 16 singles in the Top 20, including nine in the Top 10. The reason? He had just released a new album, ÷, and fans were streaming it in their millions.</p><p>The Official Chart Company responded by rewriting its rules. Since June 2017, artists have only been allowed three songs in the Top 100 at any one time.</p><p>The changes are meant to \"ensure the chart continues to be a showcase for the new hits and talent which are the lifeblood of UK music\".</p><p>\"This is not a chart for album tracks; we want to remain the Official Singles Chart, for singles,\" chief executive Martin Talbot told NME.</p><p>\"It's tougher than ever for new music and developing artists to break through, and this is us doing our bit,\" he added.</p><p>However, sneaky old Ed Sheeran has found a loophole. This August, the star had seven entries in the Top 100 - three as a solo act, and four as a guest vocalist on songs by Camila Cabello, Burna Boy, Fireboy DML and Russ.</p><p>There's no stopping him, is there?</p><p>The other way that streaming affects the singles chart is the avalanche of Christmas songs which appear every December, as everyone plays Now That's What I Call Christmas on a loop.</p><p>Last year, 29 of the top 40 singles on Christmas week were festive favourites like Last Christmas, Santa Baby and Let It Snow,</p><p>But 2020 threw up a strange anomaly: Ellie Goulding's cover of Joni Mitchell's River soared to the top of the charts, beating all of those perennial favourites.</p><p>On the face of it, the feat seemed impossible. The song was exclusive to Amazon - meaning the only way to it was to stream or download it on their Music app, or to play it on Ellie's YouTube channel. River was not available on Spotify or Apple Music, and you could not buy it in the shops.</p><p>Even so, it clocked up 78,000 sales. But, as many people pointed out, she had an unfair advantage.</p><p>Amazon gave River a prominent place on its Christmas-themed playlists. So every time someone said, \"Alexa, play me Christmas music\" while they boiled their sprouts, they inevitably heard Ellie's song. And each of those plays counted towards the chart.</p><p>What is more, the charts are weighted in favour of new songs - meaning River earned one \"sale\" when it was streamed 100 times on Amazon's subscription service; while Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You needed 200 streams before a \"sale\" was counted.</p><p>So while Ellie's number one was not a fix, it certainly felt suspicious - and the debate over whether active streams (where the listener selects a song and presses play) and passive streams (where the song plays automatically) should be counted differently still rages today.</p>",

Hopefully things can find a way to recover,\" Mr Bankman-Fried, nicknamed the 'King of Crypto', wrote on Twitter on Friday.</p><p>\"I was shocked to see things unravel the way they did.\"</p><p>Prior to the meltdown, Mr Bankman-Fried had been one of the stars of the crypto scene, drawing comparisons to investment magnate Warren Buffett, with a net worth estimated at more than $15bn (£12.8bn) as recently as Monday.</p><p>But rumours earlier this week that FTX and other firms owned by Mr Bankman-Fried were on shaky financial ground prompted a mass of customers to try to withdraw funds from FTX, an exchange used to buy and sell digital tokens.</p><p>Facing a cash crunch, Mr Bankman-Fried tried to organize a bailout but that failed, leaving FTX scrambling to raise billions of dollars and many customers unable to access their money.</p><p>By filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the company can continue operating, while restructuring its debts under court supervision.</p><p>FTX said the goal was to \"begin an orderly process to review and monetize assets for the benefit of all global stakeholders\".</p><p>\"The FTX Group has valuable assets that can only be effectively administered in an organised, joint process,\" said new chief executive John J Ray III, a lawyer who previously worked at a venture capital firm and has experience with high-profile bankruptcy cases.</p><p>In the filing, FTX estimated that it had between $10bn and $50bn in assets and liabilities and more than 100,000 creditors.</p><p>The proceeding involves FTX as well as Alameda Research, a trading firm founded by Mr Bankman-Fried, and roughly 130 affiliates, according to the statement FTX shared on Twitter.</p><p>Those include FTX's operations in the US, which Mr Bankman-Fried had said on Thursday were unaffected.</p><p>Mr Bankman-Fried said \"this doesn't necessarily have to mean the end for the companies or their ability to provide value and funds to their customers chiefly, and can be consistent with other routes.</p><p>\"Ultimately I'm optimistic that Mr. Ray and others can help provide whatever is best\".</p><p>For now, Thomas Culham, from Kingston, said he has been unable to withdraw the £2,000 he had put into FTX - a \"big blow\" as his funds in FTX were \"decent chunk\" of his investment portfolio.</p><p>\"It's probably gone,\" the 22-year-old said. \"Maybe in a few years' time I might get some sort of recovery - they do have assets [and] they should be able to liquidate them.\"</p><p>Mr Bankman-Fried had enjoyed a high-profile in the crypto industry and beyond, frequently speaking on behalf of the sector before regulators.</p><p>He was a major donor to Democrats in the most recent US elections and had gone on an advertising blitz in the country, enlisting celebrities such as Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen to convince the public that crypto was a worthy investment.</p><p>But as he became a bigger figure, questions were raised about the ties between the different parts of his business empire and potential conflicts of interest between FTX and Alameda.</p><p>The troubles at his firms have hurt the rest of the crypto market, with currencies such as Bitcoin dropping 20% this week, and raised pressure on other companies to prove they have the financial strength to stay afloat.</p><p>Several companies in the sector had already collapsed or approached collapse earlier this year, after a sharp downturn in the value of digital assets. BlockFi, another crypto firm with ties to FTX, stopped clients from making withdrawals on Thursday because of the situation.</p><p>\"FTX going down is not good for anyone in the industry. Do not view it as a win for us. User confidence is severely shaken,\" wrote Changpeng Zhao, the chief executive of FTX's larger rival, Binance, which had said it might buy FTX this week only to walk away.</p><p>Regulators have long warned of risks to crypto investors and raised concern about the threat of wider financial turmoil, as traditional financial companies expand their investments in the market, despite little regulation.</p><p>FTX, which is now reportedly under investigation by several financial authorities, had enjoyed backing from major investment firms, including Blackrock, Softbank and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan in Canada.</p><p>But Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said he did not think FTX's troubles would spark wider problems in the stock market.</p><p>\"It's a black swan event. There's really no bleed over into the overall market, there's containment,\" he said. \"That's extremely important and another positive signal in terms of the walls between systematic risk and not.\"</p><p>Mr Bankman-Fried admitted that the downfall is \"on me\" but that will be scant consolation to the potentially 1.2 million FTX customers who could now lose their crypto savings.</p><p>Despite potentially losing his money, Mr Culham said this week's events wouldn't put him off investing in more cryptocurrencies in the future.</p><p>\"I think there's a lot of opportunity,\" he said, adding that he was not investing more than he could afford to lose, and also not investing in only one type of crypto.</p><p>Additional reporting by Michael Race.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Not many people would know what to do with 18 containers filled with rotting cabbages.</p><p>But Jake Slinn does.</p><p>The 23-year-old founder of JS Global operates in the cargo salvage industry - a small but essential cog in the machinery of global trade.</p><p>Last year one of the larger cogs in that machine got stuck in the Suez Canal. The world's biggest container ship, the Ever Given, blocked the key shipping lane for six days in March.</p><p>Part of that ship's cargo was the 18 containers, each weighing 20 tonnes, of cabbages that ended up with Mr Slinn. His Ipswich-based firm organised their delivery to an anaerobic digestion plant, where they were turned into fuel.</p><p>Cargo may need to be salvaged for a wide variety of reasons. Like the Ever Given cabbages, some goods may perish during their journey and need to be destroyed.</p><p>Local authorities may deem goods unsafe and order their destruction - a particular problem when Covid-19 hit.</p><p>\"During the pandemic we destroyed tens of thousands of items of fake PPE, mainly fake masks and fake gloves, that had been imported from China,\" says Mr Slinn, whose parents are in the waste management business.</p><p>It's not only damaged or unsafe cargo that needs to be salvaged.</p><p>If a business goes bust, its cargo may be stranded at a port somewhere. If goods are delayed, they miss a key deadline, like Christmas, and may be abandoned.</p><p>Cargo can even be unwanted because the cost of storing the items at the port or in a nearby warehouse exceeds its value to its owner.</p><p>In such cases, a salvage company will often step in and find new buyers.</p><p>Paul and Poppy Vidler of UK-based Crown Salvage have decades of experience of finding buyers for unwanted goods.</p><p>The company recently acquired containers of easy-to-assemble housing units and have been working on finding buyers.</p><p>\"We sourced them from Turkey and have been having conversations with lots of people, from places like La Palma after the volcano [eruption in 2021] as well as Ghana.</p><p>\"They can be set up quickly wherever there's a housing problem,\" says Mr Vidler.</p><p>With a big database of buyers around the world, they can take on large quantities of industrial goods, including chemicals and plastics.</p><p>\"We're larger and global, it's not like that reality TV programme,\" Mrs Vidler explains, referring to US hit show Storage Wars, where contestants bid on storage units with the goal of profiting from the abandoned goods inside them.</p><p>The salvage companies say their work is good for the environment.</p><p>\"We don't send anything to the landfill, not just because it's not good for the environment, but it's also not cost-effective,\" Mr Slinn says.</p><p>Mrs Vidler agrees. \"We're not greenwashing. What we do actually helps avoid these things ending up in landfill.\"</p><p>Aside from these environmental benefits, a more immediate benefit is that salvaging these goods helps release the handbrake on global trade, emptying containers that can then go back into circulation.</p><p>\"We'll empty a container in the morning and it's already going back out on a ship empty by the afternoon,\" Mr Slinn says.</p><p>Getting containers back into circulation was a particularly pressing issue in the immediate aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>In September 2021 the price of a 40ft (12m) container hit a high of almost $10,400 (£9,160), according to the World Container Index produced by analysts Drewry.</p><p>Since then the price has fallen back to around $2,773, well below the five-year average of around $3,759 according to the Index.</p><p>For those in the cargo salvage industry, delays, financial turmoil and strikes can all provide opportunities.</p><p>Recent industrial action in Felixstowe, the UK's largest container port resulted in an increase in abandoned cargo.</p><p>Mr Slinn disposed of a container of pork, which was due to be exported from the UK, but perished because the ship picking it up couldn't dock at the port.</p><p>\"A lot of people were abandoning their stock because of the shutdown.

It said bluntly: \"You are unlikely to get your money back if things go wrong.\"</p><p>It now has a page dealing with the FTX liquidation. Again, the message is that options for those who've invested in it are limited.</p><p>Asked about the collapse of the multi-billion dollar exchange, the Governor of the Bank of England said it did not pose risks to the wider economy.</p><p>\"I don't… anywhere detect what I would call a systemic fallout from FTX,\" Andrew Bailey said, noting that its activity in the UK was \"not very substantial\".</p><p>He added that global regulators were \"doing a lot of work\" to improve oversight of crypto assets.</p><p>\"There is ownership of crypto-currency in this country, no doubt, I get asked about it particularly when I go to schools actually, interestingly,\" he said.</p><p>\"It is not something we can be relaxed about and let me reassure you we are not relaxed about it.\"</p><p>There is at least a liquidation process in the case of FTX, which will divide up the remains of the firm among those to whom it owes money.</p><p>And founder Sam Bankman-Fried claimed in a tweet that \"my goal—my one goal—is to do right by customers\".</p><p>In many other cases there is not even a bankruptcy process.</p><p>Gavin Brown, Associate Professor in Financial Technology at the University of Liverpool, pointed to a recent report which suggested that \"42% of exchanges which failed simply disappeared without a trace\".</p><p>But the bankruptcy may not provide much comfort.</p><p>Prof Brown told the BBC: \"In the event of exchange failure, or even bankruptcy, it is the investors who are on the hook for losses.\"</p><p>He and other experts warned that often small investors will go to the back of the queue when what remains of a crypto business is divided up among creditors.</p><p>Experts doubt much money will be coming back. \"The unfortunate news is that the money's all gone. It's just not there any more. Investors should expect pennies on the dollar,\" said crypto blogger and author David Gerard.</p><p>Mr Gerard argued that in many of these failures there are \"real liabilities but imaginary assets\" and that a huge proportion of the assets are in exchanges' own tokens - such as FTX's FTT token - to which \"they've assigned a spurious value in the billions\".</p><p>The FCA says people worried about their finances should go to a government-backed organisation, Moneyhelper. But Moneyhelper is an advice service, and can only offer guidance on how to survive when your savings vanish.</p><p>With some mainstream investments it's possible to receive compensation if an institution collapses - for example a bank or building society - through the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS)</p><p>But the FSCS says it doesn't protect crypto assets, as they are not a regulated financial product in the UK - all it can do is warn consumers of the risks, and provide tools to check if their investment is protected by the scheme.</p><p>The organisation says crypto currency is something that consumers ask about every week, either via its customer service team, social media or searching for information on its website.</p><p>It says \"crypto\" is one of the most popular words searched for on its website.</p><p>Daniel Seely, financial services associate for law firm Freeths, told the BBC: \"The short answer is that there isn't much recourse available.\"</p><p>With a few exceptions, crypto assets fall largely outside the scope of regulators and watchdogs - for example, the Financial Ombudsman Service - and so consumers \"don't have a clear right to recourse in the same way they may with other products\".</p><p>Consumers, argued Mr Seely, could consider pursuing civil claims against parties involved in an investment, such as brokers or financial advisers if they were used, \"but realistically if it is just a case that the investments didn't go as planned, there is currently little they can do to recoup losses\".</p><p>The Financial Services and Markets Bill currently being scrutinised by parliament will begin to bring in some additional regulation for crypto, but in the meantime Mr Seely said it remained a \"very risky area for consumers looking to invest\".</p><p>Haider Rafique - from OKX, a crypto exchange - said there were some steps consumers could take to protect themselves against similar losses in the future, in particular by thinking carefully about where they stored their assets.</p><p>\"Unless they are active traders, we encourage our customers to store their crypto currencies on a non-custodial decentralised wallet,\"he said.</p><p>\"In the industry we say: 'Not your keys, not your crypto.' Recent events prove it has never been truer.\"</p><p>Benjamin Dean, director of WisdomTree Investments, an asset management firm, urged people to think about investments in blockchain-related technology the same way they would more conventional assets, like stocks, shares or gold.</p><p>\"Do not invest more money than you can afford to lose, and never invest your money with companies which operate unregulated, off-shore exchanges\", he advised.</p><p>\"If you do not research where you are investing your money, then you are running a very high risk of losing all your investment.\"</p><p>Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy for consumer group Which? warned: \"Crypto assets are very high-risk and speculative. Investors face losing all their money if they decide to buy them, as they often come with limited consumer protections.\"</p>",

We will lose talented Amazonians from the devices & services org\".</p><p>Across the tech industry, at firms like Twitter, Meta, Coinbase and Snap, workers have announced they are \"seeking new opportunities\".</p><p>Worldwide, more than 120,000 jobs have been lost, according to the Layoffs.fyi website, which tracks tech job cuts.</p><p>Different firms cut employees for different reasons but there are common themes.</p><p>As our lives moved online during the pandemic, the tech giants' businesses boomed, and executives believed the good times - for them - would continue to roll.</p><p>Meta, for example, took on more than 15,000 people in the first nine months of this year.</p><p>Now executives announcing cuts have said they miscalculated.</p><p>\"I made the decision to significantly increase our investments,\" chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told Meta employees, as he laid off 13% of them.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.\"</p><p>Online adverts are the chief source of income for many tech firms, but for the advertising business, dark clouds have been gathering. Firms have faced growing opposition to intrusive advertising practices. For example, Apple made it harder to track people's online activity and sell that data to advertisers.</p><p>And as the economy ran into trouble, many firms slashed their online advertising budgets.</p><p>In the financial technology sector, rising interest rates have also hit companies.</p><p>\"It's been a really a disappointing quarter of earnings for many of the big tech companies,\" said technology analyst Paolo Pescatore of PP Foresight. \"No-one's immune.\"</p><p>Even Apple has signalled caution, with chief executive Tim Cook saying the firm was \"still hiring\", but only on a \"deliberate basis.\"</p><p>Amazon attributed its job cuts to an \"unusual and uncertain macroeconomic environment\" forcing it to prioritize on what mattered most to customers.</p><p>\"As part of our annual operating planning review process, we always look at each of our businesses and what we believe we should change,\" spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said.</p><p>\"As we've gone through this, given the current macro-economic environment (as well as several years of rapid hiring), some teams are making adjustments, which in some cases means certain roles are no longer necessary. We don't take these decisions lightly, and we are working to support any employees who may be affected.\"</p><p>Investors have also piled on the pressure to cut costs, accusing firms of being bloated and slow to respond to signs of slowdown.</p><p>In an open letter to Alphabet, parent company of Google and YouTube, activist investor Sir Christopher Hohn urged the firm to slash jobs and pay.</p><p>Alphabet had to be more disciplined about costs, he wrote, and cut losses from projects like its self-driving car company, Waymo.</p><p>Elon Musk is certainly of the view that there is room to cut costs at his latest investment, Twitter, which has struggled to either turn a profit or attract new users.</p><p>Added to that, many commentators argue Mr Musk paid over the odds for the firm, and the pressure is on to make his investment worthwhile.</p><p>He laid off half the firm's employees; and for those who remain an \"extreme\" work ethic is promised.</p><p>According to US media reports on Tuesday, Mr Musk told staff they needed to commit to a \"hardcore\" culture of \"long hours at high intensity\" or leave.</p><p>Industry watcher Scott Kessler also says there is less tolerance for big spending on high-tech gambles like virtual reality or driverless cars that may not pay off in the short term.</p><p>Investors also see the high wages and cushy perks some enjoy in the industry as unsustainable.</p><p>\"Some companies have had to face harsh realities,\" he said.</p><p>Mike Morini, from WorkForce Software, which provides digital management tools said it appeared to be a turning point.</p><p>\"The tech industry is exiting a period of growth at all costs,\" he said.</p><p>But while the big tech firms may be buffeted by economic headwinds, they are not broken.</p><p>Amazon's proposed 10,000 job cuts in corporate and technology roles - its biggest such reduction to date - represents only 3% of its office staff.</p><p>And the lay-offs may also be the start of new businesses as talented staff, dumped by the big firms, join or create start-ups.</p><p>As veteran Silicon Valley watcher Mike Malone recently told the BBC: \"I won't write the Valley off yet. I still have a lot of hope.\"</p>",

Only exceptional performance will constitute a passing grade,\" he said.</p><p>Workers were told that they needed to click on a link by 17:00 EST on Thursday, if they want to be \"part of the new Twitter\".</p><p>He added: \"Whatever decision you make, thank you for your efforts to make Twitter successful.\"</p><p>The world's richest man has already announced half of Twitter's staff are being let go, after he bought the company in a $44bn (£38.7bn) deal.</p><p>Mr Musk said he had \"no choice\" over the cuts, as the company was losing $4m (£3.51m) a day.

He sometimes sleeps at the office.</p><p>And he wants that for his staff too.</p><p>His management philosophy is about putting together small collections of highly motivated and capable employees.</p><p>He says he'd much rather have a small number of exceptional people than many who are \"pretty good and moderately motivated\".</p><p>With this email, he appears to applying that philosophy.</p><p>He wants just true believers at Twitter, people who are fully aligned with what he's doing.</p><p>There are plenty of staff who do believe in Twitter's mission. There are also staff working for Twitter who will relish working closely with Mr Musk.</p><p>But his directives to staff feel at times autocratic. The danger is he loses top staff by appearing cavalier and arrogant.</p><p>And of course, if everyone at Twitter decided to take Elon Musk's offer of severance at once, it's hard to see how Twitter could function in the short term.</p><p>Mr Musk himself has been sleeping at Twitter in recent weeks, even while leading electric carmaker Tesla and rocket company SpaceX.</p><p>He described his work habits in a US court on Wednesday, where he appeared to defend the eye-popping $56bn pay package he received from electric carmaker Tesla in 2018.</p><p>\"I pretty much work all the time, with rare exceptions.\" he said.</p><p>In response to questioning, he later added that the \"fundamental organisational restructuring\" at Twitter would be complete by the end of this week.</p><p>One way Mr Musk could lighten his workload is by sharing the leadership of his other companies.</p><p>At the hearing, James Murdoch, a Tesla director and the son of media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, said that Mr Musk had identified a potential successor to head the car maker.</p><p>Asked to confirm that Mr Musk had never identified a potential new Tesla chief executive, Mr Murdoch said \"he actually has\", adding that it had happened in the \"last few months\". He didn't identify who the potential successor was.</p><p>Dan Ives, a senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, said that Twitter's culture had \"dramatically changed\" with Mr Musk at the helm.</p><p>\"Elon Musk is not going to be doing candlelight dinners and playing ping pong in Twitter's cafeteria and this is a shock to the system,\" he said.</p><p>\"But he also needs to play nice in the sandbox because if key Twitter engineers and developers leave, this will be a major void in the Twitter ecosystem,\" he warned. \"There's a careful balance ahead for him, in this tightrope act.\"</p><p>Do you work long hours either willingly or because you feel you have no choice?

        "content": "<p>She was \"the world's youngest self-made female billionaire\", trumpeted Forbes magazine. The \"next Steve Jobs\", said Inc, another business magazine that put her on the cover.</p><p>In 2014, Elizabeth Holmes, then 30 years old, was on top of the world. A Stanford University drop-out, she had founded a company valued at $9bn (£6.5bn) for supposedly bringing about a revolution in diagnosing disease.</p><p>With a few drops of blood, Theranos promised that its Edison test could detect conditions such as cancer and diabetes quickly without the hassle of needles. Bigwigs from Henry Kissinger to general James Mattis sat on the board.</p><p>But by 2015, the seams were coming apart, and within a year, Holmes was exposed as a fake. The technology she touted didn't work at all, and by 2018 the company she founded had collapsed.</p><p>In January, she was convicted by a jury in California on four counts of fraud, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.</p><p>The jury found her not guilty on four other charges and failed to reach a verdict on three more. Holmes, who had pleaded not guilty to all charges, sought a new trial but those requests were denied.</p><p>She is due to be sentenced on Friday, but is still expected to appeal.</p><p>During the trial Holmes accused her ex-boyfriend and business partner, Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani, of emotional and sexual abuse at the time of the alleged crimes, impairing her mental state.</p><p>Balwani, 56, who faced the same fraud charges, was convicted in July and is due to be sentenced next month. He had called the claims \"outrageous\".</p><p>Despite being the subject of a book, HBO documentary and an upcoming TV series and film, it is still unclear why Holmes took such a gamble on technology she knew didn't work.</p><p>She was raised in a comfortably well-off family in Washington DC, and was a polite but withdrawn child, according to people who knew her.</p><p>Inventor and businessman Richard Fuisz, 81, speculated there must have been immense pressure on Holmes to succeed. His family lived next door to the Holmes family for years but they fell out when Theranos sued him over a patent dispute in 2011 (it was later settled).</p><p>Holmes's parents spent much of their careers as bureaucrats on Capitol Hill but \"they were very interested in status\" and \"lived for connections\", he told the BBC. Her father's great great grandfather founded Fleischmann's Yeast, which changed America's bread industry, and the family was very conscious about its lineage, he said.</p><p>At age nine, the young Elizabeth wrote a letter to her father declaring that what she \"really want[ed] out of life is to discover something new, something that mankind didn't know was possible to do\".</p><p>When she got to Stanford University in 2002 to study chemical engineering, she came up with an idea for a patch that could scan the wearer for infections and release antibiotics as needed.</p><p>At 18, she already displayed an intransigence that would apparently continue and drive the company she would found the following year.</p><p>Phyllis Gardner, an expert in clinical pharmacology at Stanford, recalled discussing Holmes's skin patch idea and telling her it \"wouldn't work\".</p><p>\"She just stared through me,\" Dr Gardner told the BBC.</p><p>\"And she just seemed absolutely confident of her own brilliance. She wasn't interested in my expertise and it was upsetting.\"</p><p>Months later Holmes dropped out of Stanford aged 19 and launched Theranos, this time coming up with an apparently revolutionary way of testing blood from a simple finger prick.</p><p>Powerful people were enthralled and invested without seeing audited financial accounts.</p><p>US Treasury Secretary George Schultz, media tycoon Rupert Murdoch and America's richest family, the Waltons, were among her backers.</p><p>The support lent her credibility, as did her demeanour.</p><p>\"I knew she'd had this brilliant idea and that she had managed to convince all these investors and scientists,\" said Dr Jeffrey Flier, the former dean of Harvard Medical School, who met her for lunch in 2015.</p><p>\"She was self-assured, but when I asked her several questions about her technology she didn't look like she understood,\" added Dr Flier, who never formally assessed her technology. \"It seemed a bit odd but I didn't come away thinking it was a fraud.\"</p><p>Dr Flier ended up inviting her to join the medical school's Board of Fellows, which he regrets, although she was removed when the scandal broke.</p><p>It began to unravel in 2015 when a whistleblower raised concerns about Theranos's flagship testing device, the Edison. The Wall Street Journal wrote a series of damning exposes claiming the results were unreliable and that the firm had been using commercially available machines made by other manufacturers for most of its testing.</p><p>Lawsuits piled up, partners cut ties and in 2016 US regulators banned Holmes from operating a blood-testing service for two years.</p><p>In 2018 Theranos was dissolved.</p><p>In March that year, Holmes settled civil charges from financial regulators that she fraudulently raised $700m from investors.</p><p>But three months later she was arrested, along with Mr Balwani, on criminal charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.</p><p>Prosecutors claimed she knowingly misled patients about the tests and vastly exaggerated the firm's performance to financial backers.</p><p>As the Theranos scandal reached trial, commentators said it was remarkable how tightly Holmes clung to her original story and people who knew her said they doubt she has changed.</p><p>Since the trial, Holmes has been living in California with partner William \"Billy\" Evans, 27, an heir to the Evans Hotel Group. They had a son in July 2021 and she is pregnant with their second child.</p><p>Emily Baker, a former deputy district attorney for Los Angeles, told the BBC before the verdict that the sentencing judge might take into account Holmes's status as a young mother if she was found guilty, opting for a more minor punishment.</p><p>Holmes's attorneys had said she should not face prison time on the grounds that she was not a danger to society. They offered testimony from more than 130 people on her behalf, including Senator Cory Booker.</p><p>But prosecutors requested that she face 15 years in prison and a payment of $800m, arguing that she was \"blinded\" by ambition, which put \"and will continue to put, people in harm's way\".</p><p>\"She accepts no responsibility,\" they wrote in court filings. \"Quite the opposite, she insists she is the victim.\"</p>",

World leaders, politicians and celebrities all have personal Twitter accounts with millions of followers - a low-hanging fruit for a hacker wanting a lot of people to see their scam, as we have seen before.</p><p>Or they might just want it to disappear, so they bombard it with web traffic to see if it gets overwhelmed and shuts down that way. Attempts like this will be happening all the time - it's a constant battle.</p><p>Cyber security is, or at least should be, an important part of any 21st century company's day-to-day operations. Last week Twitter's head of cyber security, Lea Kissner, left. It's not known if they were replaced. (Twitter also has no communications team, so there's no easy way to ask).</p><p>Twitter's security is likely to be pretty robust. You can't run a site used by 300 million people every month that's held together with a bit of string. But that robustness requires continuing maintenance.</p><p>Think about your own phone, or laptop, and the regular security updates you have to install. That's because new vulnerabilities are regularly unearthed, new chinks in the armour that you didn't know you had, and it's the job of the provider to send you the fix.</p><p>The second potential disaster is that the servers are knocked out - either by someone with a grudge, or by mistake during a routine bit of maintenance that's not properly supervised.</p><p>Without servers, there is no Twitter (or Facebook, or Instagram or indeed our digital world).</p><p>Servers - powerful computers - are like the physical bodies of these platforms. They exist in data centres. These are effectively warehouses full of computer servers which are central to the operations of online businesses. The world runs on servers.</p><p>As you can imagine, all of those machines generate a lot of heat. Data centres have to be kept cool, and they require a constant source of electricity.</p><p>The servers themselves also require maintenance and replacement, as data gets migrated between them. All of that has the capacity for something to go wrong. It would be sudden and dramatic if it did.</p><p>Elon Musk knows all this, of course. Let's not assume that he doesn't. However he may choose to play the buffoon.</p><p>We don't know who is currently keeping watch.</p><p>But something happened to me yesterday that made me think perhaps there are more people at Twitter watching than we think.</p><p>I told the story about an astronomer who was locked out of her account after wrongly falling foul of automated moderation tools. Nobody at Twitter or Mr Musk's other firms responded to me, or made contact with her. But her account was indeed restored later that day.</p><p>Somebody, somewhere inside Twitter, was paying attention. Perhaps there are still enough of them who are doing just that.</p><p>There's always the nuclear option that Musk declares Twitter bankrupt, and it gets wound down.</p><p>You can follow Zoe Kleinman on Twitter (@zsk), as well as on Mastodon (@zsk@mastadonapp.uk).</p>",

        "content": "<p>Vanuatu's government has been knocked offline for more than 11 days after a suspected cyber-attack on servers in the country.</p><p>The hack has disabled the websites of the Pacific island's parliament, police and prime minister's office.</p><p>It has also taken down the email system, intranet and online databases of schools, hospitals and other emergency services as well as all government services and departments.</p><p>The shutdown has left the nation's population - about 315,000 people living across several islands - scrambling to carry out basic tasks like paying tax, invoicing bills and getting licences and travel visas.</p><p>Essentially anyone with a gov.vu email or domain has been affected, locals told the BBC.</p><p>\"Anyone who tried to do anything with the government knew the system was down,\" said Ginny Stein, an Australian journalist and communications consultant who spent years living in Port Vila, and left on Monday.</p><p>\"My experience of trying to check out of the country... well they just couldn't operate. They were really struggling to get basic things done.\"</p><p>She described major delays to any applications to government as officials have resorted to manual systems and in many cases even shut up shop.</p><p>\"You'd walk into the offices and they were closed or they were turning you away saying 'come back next week maybe, but we don't know',\" she said.</p><p>Still, government staff have done their best to keep things going - with some using their own personal emails and internet hotspots for essential work.</p><p>Instead of electronic transfers, people have been paid with cheques. One civil servant relayed the experience of walking from department to department to get the relevant checks and sign-offs on an application. Others have been taking notes manually.</p><p>According to civil servants who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, it appears the government's servers were taken out on Friday 4 November.</p><p>Emails bouncing back from government addresses were the first sign something was wrong, residents said.</p><p>\"If you take out the government internet… it affects everything. You want to do shipping? You've got to get stuff through approvals through customs. It affect airlines. It affects the health system - there isn't one bit of it that's unaffected,\" said Ms Stein.</p><p>No one from the government or the Prime Minister's office has yet returned the BBC's calls.</p><p>But AFP news agency and the Vanuatu Daily Post carried a government statement saying its online system had been \"compromised\" for two days.</p><p>There appears to be a financial motivation. Australian newspaper The Sydney Morning Herald reported the attackers had demanded a ransom, which the Vanuatu government refused to pay.</p><p>No detail has been disclosed about the value of that extortion bid, or who the hackers are.</p><p>It's also unclear how the attack occurred and what protections Vanuatu had in place. Experts have noted the whole system was likely centralised and hosted on the government's own servers, a fundamental security flaw.</p><p>The island has already pledged to upgrade its system. In the meantime it's asked neighbouring Australia - traditionally its largest aid partner - to help rebuild its network.</p><p>As of Wednesday, the government domain was still down. A spokesman told the Herald the government's website \"should be back next week\".</p><p>Why might Vanuatu have been targeted?</p><p>The attack has come less than a month after a new government was elected - a potential time of vulnerability. \"But the new government has responded quickly and not agreed to the ransom request,\" said Dr Meg Keen, director of the Pacific Islands Programme at the Sydney-based Lowy Institute.</p><p>\"We don't yet know who is behind this attack, but a government spokesman has suggested it was an outside attack, likely from the Asia region.\"</p><p>Some have speculated that the hack may have originated in Indonesia. Vanuatu has long supported the independence movement in the Indonesian province of West Papua, where much of the population is Melanesian. The Indonesian military is accused of gross human rights abuses in the province.</p><p>Others note Vanuatu's position in the Pacific region - as a key nation that has relations with the US, China, Australia and New Zealand.</p><p>This year has seen Pacific Island nations courted by both Washington and Beijing. Island leaders were invited to the White House in September, while China's foreign minister carried out a whistle-stop tour around the Pacific in June seeking a regional deal.</p><p>In recent years, Vanuatu has become one of the Pacific islands closest to Beijing. Chinese investment has built its parliament house, sporting stadium and convention centre. Beijing has an embassy in Port Vila, while Washington's representation is a three-hour flight away in Papua New Guinea.</p><p>However, Australia - allied with the US - has for over four decades been Vanuatu's largest aid donor and closest security partner.</p><p>Internet provision is a critical utility. Last year, the Australian government funded its telecoms giant Telstra's purchase of Digicel Pacific, a Pacific telecoms company, in a move widely seen as a political block to China's influence in the region.</p><p>There had been talk that Digicel might sell its Pacific arm to Chinese state-owned operator China Mobile. Australia also secured an internet cable for the neighbouring Solomon Islands in 2018.</p><p>Dr Keen said Vanuatu, like other countries, aimed to secure its government information from external attacks. She noted a \"global vulnerability\" to such attacks - including in Australia, where hacks on a health insurer and telecommunications firm in recent weeks have exposed data of nearly half the population.</p><p>But Vanuatu has far fewer resources. Its economy is largely reliant on farming and tourism. The low-lying nation has been ranked among the most vulnerable to climate change.</p><p>\"The attack is an added strain on public systems,\" Dr Keen said.</p><p>Ms Stein, who had worked in government departments in Vanuatu, noted the country's internet system had appeared fragile - with variable internet coverage and limited server capacity.</p><p>\"It's a really miserable thing to do to a small island nation that just doesn't have the resources to deal with this,\" she said.</p>",

Does corporate fraud in Silicon Valley end up with a slap on the wrist? Or does it mean serious jail time?</p><p>We are about to find out.</p><p>Elizabeth Holmes' long wait for a verdict is unusual.

Please give us time to process. We don't know anything more.\"</p><p>Fletcher, Woodburne and Moloney are currently booked to say farewell to UK fans in person in Neighbours: The Farewell Tour next March.</p><p>Reacting to the news, the team behind the tour tweeted: \"First things first, we are thrilled that Neighbours is coming back. As for The Farewell Tour, it will absolutely be going ahead as planned - we just need a new name.\"</p><p>Speaking to BBC News, the show's producer Dean Elliott added: \"Now we can have an even bigger celebration next year, turning what was already going to be an amazing look back at the iconic soap into an even bigger celebration of its return and its future.\"</p><p>TV critic Scott Bryan told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"This will be, I think, the first time that a big streamer has invested a significant amount of money in a soap. Normally it's a limited series. A limited series is generally quite low stakes because if it doesn't get the hits that you want for that show, you just easily cancel it.</p><p>\"Soaps are actually really quite expensive commitments because, even though each episode is quite cheap, you've got so many different cast members, you've got to have a permanent base, it's a big crew.\"</p><p>The new series will be on subscription service Amazon Prime Video in Australia, New Zealand and Canada, while it will be once again broadcast on TV channel Network 10 in Australia. Previous episodes will also be available to stream.</p><p>Amazon executive Lauren Anderson said: \"Neighbours has captivated its audience for nearly 40 years, building a dedicated and loyal following for the lives and stories of the characters on Ramsay Street.</p><p>\"With the power of streaming, we're able to offer a catalogue of thousands of Neighbours episodes for new audiences to discover this legendary series and current fans to relive their favourite moments.</p><p>\"We look forward to immersing the audience in new Ramsay Street experiences when we relaunch the show next year for Amazon Freevee and Prime Video customers.\"</p>",

        "content": "<p>\"Hey everyone, there's a food delivery today at 3pm.\" \"Thanks for the curry, it was amazing!\" \"I made pickles this week.\" \"Should we all have an outing somewhere soon?\"</p><p>These are the kind of messages that fly back and forth, pretty much constantly, on Rachel Diamond's phone.</p><p>Ms Diamond is the founder of My Yard, a charity. For each of the communities she is plugged into, she runs a WhatsApp group, such as the one she set up in 2018 for dozens of people who live on the Grange Farm Estate in Harrow, north-west London.</p><p>\"It not only feeds people, it brings the community together,\" explains Ms Diamond.</p><p>Many residents on the estate are among the millions of people in the UK who are currently experiencing food insecurity.</p><p>The cost of living crisis has sent demand for food aid soaring. You'll have heard of food banks but food aid takes many different forms. Some are less visible than others and, around the country, many people are now quietly organising the sharing and redistribution of food themselves.</p><p>Often, it starts with a WhatsApp group for friends and neighbours.</p><p>When she first started working with the Grange Farm Estate community, Ms Diamond found that using a messaging app allowed her to organise deliveries of food donated by supermarkets and local businesses at the residents' convenience.</p><p>\"It was a stigma-free way of people accessing food and getting to know each other,\" she says. \"For me, it's really, really special.\"</p><p>Now she has about 20 groups that are swapping messages about food.</p><p>It has helped her keep in touch with those who have dietary requirements or particular preferences. Some of the elderly people find that the price of Spam has gone up a lot lately, so she gets dented tins unwanted by shops.</p><p>Everyone is different, she stresses, asking me to imagine freezing a supermarket in time and having a look inside every shopper's basket: \"I bet you'd never find two baskets with the same things in. That is people's lives.\"</p><p>She aims to supply a diverse variety of food that suits everyone. But due to inflation, the overall need is growing. \"It's devastating,\" says Ms Diamond, referring to the cost of living crisis.</p><p>On one recent delivery, a van arrived packed with pallets of food including fresh fruit and vegetables, breads and yoghurt, among other items. Everything went in about ten minutes, she says. It used to take noticeably longer.</p><p>While Ms Diamond has been running WhatsApp groups for communities for years, new ones are springing up all the time elsewhere.</p><p>Last November, Camille Desprez, founder of Food Next Door, launched a group for the residents of her block of flats in Brixton so that they could share surplus food with one another and cut down on waste.</p><p>\"[It's] working super well. We are able to save food almost every week,\" she says.</p><p>Ms Desprez has since developed the idea into the Food Next Door project, which has more than 100 members and which is establishing WhatsApp groups across more than a dozen neighbourhoods in London and Paris.</p><p>One benefit, she adds, is that people can save money on food, noting that among those currently taking part are some refugees.</p><p>Zero Waste initiatives that help people in poverty are a \"positive side-effect\" of the movement, says Zero Waste consultant Rachelle Strauss.</p><p>\"People are genuinely very frightened and very scared about their future,\" she adds, noting the seriousness of the current situation.</p><p>While WhatsApp, being so widely used, has its benefits, it also has downsides, says Prof Reem Talhouk at Northumbria University. The messaging app sometimes goes down for hours at a time. This could be significant for anyone depending on the app for aid or their livelihood.</p><p>Alternative apps include Telegram and Signal. Volunteers for the Foodshare Allotment at Nottingham Trent University stay in touch via Microsoft Teams chat. Some food from their allotment goes to food banks, community kitchens and local families.</p><p>And plenty of people share food without much need for the latest technology - such as Ursula Juta, senior project officer at the Norfolk Rivers Trust, who puts a basket full of surplus veg from her allotment on her garden wall. People in her village can enjoy the produce for free.</p><p>Another issue with WhatsApp and other social media platforms raised by Prof Talhouk is that they can sometimes be used for misinformation, scamming and harassment.</p><p>\"That's always something that we need to consider,\" she says.</p><p>And yet the potential power of messaging apps is hard to overstate. Another food aid provider who uses WhatsApp is Emily Connally, managing director of Cherwell Collective, a non-profit in Oxford.</p><p>\"We can mobilise 200 people with one text,\" she says, noting how she doesn't get as immediate a response on Facebook as she does via her WhatsApp group. This matters because she sometimes receives a donation of food that is near to its use by date, meaning it must be distributed very quickly.</p><p>The local Pret a Manger recently donated a surplus of 165 sandwiches. A message went out to the WhatsApp group and people had collected all the sandwiches within an hour, says Dr Connally.</p><p>Hundreds of locals rely on the food aid that she and her colleagues provide. \"We've seen a pretty dramatic increase and I think it will get much, much worse,\" she says, referring to rising food prices.</p><p>Cherwell Collective was founded during the pandemic. Prof Talhouk suggests that local community groups that respond to crises might need support, for example from local authorities, to continue their work long-term.</p><p>Back at My Yard, Rachel Diamond stresses that the impact of the groups she runs is not restricted to food aid. People help each other out with other problems, too. They confront loneliness and strengthen social bonds.</p><p>\"I find it absolutely fascinating,\" she says, \"watching people grow in their friendships - and their hope\".</p>",

There has been no response.</p><p>Ms McIntyre said other astronomers had shared the video on her behalf without consequences.</p><p>She was worried that if she agreed to Twitter's rules of re-instatement, her non-existent misdemeanour might be flagged up, as she has regular checks in order to work with school-aged children, explaining astronomy.</p><p>\"I miss the interaction,\" she said of her locked account. \"I feel a bit cut off from the astronomy world.\"</p><p>US meteorologist Ryan Vaughan faced a similar ban after sharing a video of combine harvesters working in a field at night.

Apart from the unfairness, it means the AI model isn't getting feedback, so it will never learn to improve.\"</p><p>It is not a problem that is unique to Twitter: in 2021 the owner of a small digital photo gallery had pictures of wildlife, landscapes and buildings blocked by Facebook, on the grounds that they contained \"overtly sexual\" content.</p><p>Follow Zoe Kleinman on Twitter @zsk</p>",

        "content": "<p>Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes has been sentenced to over 11 years in prison for defrauding investors in her blood testing start-up that was once valued at $9bn (£7.5bn).</p><p>The former Silicon Valley star falsely claimed the technology could diagnose disease with just a few drops of blood.</p><p>Holmes, 38, who is pregnant, tearfully told the court she felt \"deep pain\" for those misled by the scam.</p><p>She was found guilty in January after a three-month trial.</p><p>Holmes is expected to appeal against the sentence, which was handed down on Friday in a California court.</p><p>Once hailed as the \"next Steve Jobs\", she was at one time said to be the world's youngest self-made billionaire.</p><p>She launched Theranos after dropping out of Stanford University at age 19, and its value rose sharply after the company claimed it could bring about a revolution in disease diagnosis.</p><p>But the technology Holmes touted did not work and - awash in lawsuits - the company was dissolved by 2018.</p><p>At Holmes' trial in San Jose, California, prosecutors said she knowingly misled doctors and patients about Theranos' flagship product - the Edison machine - which the company claimed could detect cancer, diabetes and other conditions using just a few drops of blood.</p><p>They also accused Holmes of vastly exaggerating the firm's performance to its financial backers.</p><p>Jurors ultimately found her guilty on four counts of fraud, with a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. But they found her not guilty on four other charges, and failed to reach a verdict on three more.</p><p>Before Judge Edward Davila issued his sentence on Friday, Holmes read a speech to the court in which she tearfully apologised to investors and patients.</p><p>\"I am devastated by my failings. I have felt deep pain for what people went through, because I failed them,\" she said.</p><p>\"I regret my failings with every cell of my body,\" she continued.</p><p>The judge referred to Holmes as a \"brilliant\" entrepreneur, and told her: \"Failure is normal. But failure by fraud is not OK.\"</p><p>Silicon Valley is a place where fortunes can be made and squandered. It's not unusual for investors to lose big sums of money.</p><p>It's also not unusual for founders to make grandiose claims about their tech.</p><p>What is different about Holmes' case, though, is that Theranos' unwinding actually led to fraud charges that stuck.</p><p>It is notoriously difficult to get successful prosecutions in cases of white-collar fraud in the US.</p><p>When investors lose money, they often simply write it off, or pursue compensation privately.</p><p>Holmes' punishment is a warning for Silicon Valley executives that there are real consequences for misleading investors.</p><p>This isn't a slap on the wrist, it's significant time in prison.</p><p>She is required to surrender to begin serving her sentence on 27 April.</p><p>Holmes and Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani, her former business partner and lover, were charged in 2018 with wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Balwani, who was tried separately, was found guilty of fraud this summer. He will be sentenced next month.</p><p>Prosecutors requested that she face 15 years in prison and pay some $800m in restitution to investors, including several high-profile figures such as former US Secretary of Defense James Mattis, who testified against her at the trial, and software tycoon Larry Ellison.</p><p>But Holmes' defence team - who argued she was well-intentioned and trying to help people - said she should spend 18 months under house arrest.</p><p>The judge on Friday determined that she had caused $121m in losses to investors, including Rupert Murdoch and the family that owns Walmart. The amount she will be required to repay will be determined at a later court hearing.</p><p>Over 130 friends, family and former Theranos employees wrote to the judge to appeal for clemency.</p><p>The group noted that Holmes is a young mother. She had a son in July 2021 and is currently pregnant with her second child.</p><p>It is not known when she is due to give birth. Her lawyers are expected to try to keep her from entering prison until after the baby is born.</p><p>Her partner Billy Evans, in his sentencing memo to the court, told the judge that he fears for \"a future in which my son grows up with a relationship with his mother on the other side of glass armed by guards\".</p><p>Eileen Lepera, a Silicon Valley secretary who lost a chunk of her life savings by investing in Theranos, told the BBC she was \"happy\" with the sentence.</p><p>\"I think it's fair, considering all the facts of the case,\" Ms Lepera said. \"She [Holmes] knew it was fraud, and she put people's lives at risk.\"</p>",

        "content": "<p>Sophie Butler had just received her university results in July 2017 when she decided to squeeze in a workout before a night of celebrations.</p><p>She was using a squat machine at a gym in Basildon, Essex when she slipped and the heavy weight fell on her spine.</p><p>Aged 21, Sophie was told she was paralysed from the waist down.</p><p>As she learned to use a wheelchair, Sophie started sharing her story and gained thousands of followers on Instagram and TikTok, where she posts about everything from disability awareness to self love, fashion and fitness.</p><p>Here in her own words, she talks about her new life in the capital, where she recently modelled during London Fashion Week.</p><p>After my accident, I was in hospital on complete bedrest for months. But I was determined to make my graduation ceremony. I crammed double the amount of physiotherapy into a very short time to build up my strength. My graduation was one of the first times I had left the hospital.</p><p>It was like I had been hidden away from the world after a life-changing, traumatic event and then I was suddenly on a stage.</p><p>After that, everything felt like it had been put on hold. I just had to focus on getting through each day after waking up.</p><p>Growing up, I had a dream that I would live in London one day. I used to walk to school with my walkman on listening to Madonna, imagining myself living in the city.</p><p>But I accepted it was something I wasn't going to be able to do. For a lot of disabled people, London is not a welcoming environment, due to inaccessibility and unaffordability.</p><p>I started to believe again because, as I started to post more content, brands started wanting to work with me, and I was coming in to London for work.</p><p>The first time I got the train in on my own, it gave me so much confidence and eventually I decided to move here and I love it.</p><p>I still get nervous using the Tube but you have to deal with things when they happen. I won't let the fear of things going wrong stop me from doing things.</p><p>I've always been very into fitness but I fell out of love with it for a while. I've experienced trolling when posting fitness content, and people have said awful things like 'why would you bother to post fitness content when you look the way you do?' and calling me fat.</p><p>I began to feel like my body didn't belong to me in a fitness context, it was the object of someone's criticism. So I didn't post about fitness for a long time.</p><p>But when I moved to London, I realised there was a private gym in my apartment block so I gave myself the space to explore that again. I was very lucky to have that space as it gave me the ability to work on my relationship with fitness.</p><p>I think it says a lot about the online social media fitness industry. Influencers are posting workouts and people are following them hoping to look like that. I don't want people to follow my workouts thinking they will look like me.</p><p>It really diminishes the role that fitness can play in our lives, for our mental health and emotions. It gives me structure and it has always been a big part of my life. I'm really happy about my relationship with fitness now.</p><p>People are still not used to seeing disabled people as sexy. The way disabled men and women experience it can be very different.</p><p>As a disabled woman you can be hyper sexualised as well as infantilised at the same time. You have some people who infantilise you and don't see you in a sexual way. But others sexualise your disability against your consent.</p><p>Disabled men experience a lot of desexualisation. Both are problems. As a woman it is terrifying because you have no autonomy. People don't see us as able to give consent when it comes to sex. I think it's important to start conversations about that and try to change things.</p><p>Looking back, I didn't realise before my injury how important fashion was for me. I used to put together an outfit for a night out at university and love planning it for weeks before.</p><p>After my injury I lost a lot of my identity. I had to pay attention to the things that made me feel good. Fashion is a thing of expression for me. Even if I wasn't leaving the house, it was my way of expressing myself.</p><p>I noticed when I came out of rehab - when I was still housebound, waiting for adaptions to be done and sleeping in my Dad's conservatory - that I felt so much better on the days I was still making an effort to explore with make up and get dressed up.</p><p>Fashion has always been fun for me and it's about how it makes me feel. People sometimes find it intimidating but you can't worry about people judging you.</p><p>I was really nervous for London Fashion Week because I was so passionate about it. You don't often see wheelchair users on a runway. I had the logistical worry of what it would be like but I also knew it would mean a lot to people who would see it.</p><p>It was real genuine fear which I don't often feel. It was over so quickly. My Dad and my Step-Mum were both there and I could see them out of the corner of my eye, which was so great.</p><p>It was only afterwards, looking back, that I realised how much of a big deal it was.</p><p>Since my accident, I sometimes find it hard to look to the future. I nearly died that day and it was really hard to imagine where I would be in six months, let alone further in the future.</p><p>I spent the first few years trying to get my life back on track, physically, mentally and financially. This last year, especially since moving to London, has felt like the first time I have actually been able to enjoy my life again.</p><p>There are so many things I want to achieve. I would love to write more. For me, it has always been a natural comfort zone and I would love to get more involved in fashion because it makes me feel so good and it just really excites me.</p><p>I want to have a good balance of making the strides I want to in my career but also enjoying my life, and I feel like I'm on my way to achieving that now.</p><p>As told to Charlie Jones</p><p>Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

The ensuing violence led to the deaths of four civilians and a police officer.</p><p>Soon after the riots, Donald Trump's Facebook, Instagram and YouTube accounts, which all had tens of millions of followers - were also suspended.</p><p>Several months later, he launched his own social media platform, Truth Social.</p><p>Earlier this week, the Republican announced that he would once again run for the US presidency in 2024.</p><p>Mr Musk, the world's richest man, took control of Twitter in October in a $44bn (£37bn) deal.</p><p>He immediately embarked on a series of radical changes within the social media giant, amid concerns that he might loosen Twitter's regulations on hate speech and misinformation.</p><p>With just over a week before the US midterm elections on 8 November, he responded to questions about whether he would reinstate Mr Trump's account by tweeting: \"If I had a dollar for every time someone asked me if Trump is coming back on this platform, Twitter would be minting money!\"</p><p>Earlier this week, he told employees that the company's office buildings would be temporarily closed, with immediate effect.</p><p>The announcement comes amid reports that large numbers of staff were quitting after Mr Musk called on them to sign up for \"long hours at high intensity\" or leave.</p><p>Donald Trump knew this poll was significant - even though his official position is that he doesn't want to return to Twitter.</p><p>He urged his followers on Truth Social to take part in the poll. \"Vote now with positivity, but don't worry, we aren't going anywhere. Truth Social is special\", he said.</p><p>It's an odd statement. If Mr Trump isn't thinking of returning, why urge his followers to vote?</p><p>Part of Mr Trump's dilemma is that Truth Social has relatively few users compared with Twitter. In September, app analysts Sensor Tower estimated that just 92,000 people downloaded Truth Social. Nearly 15 million people downloaded Twitter over the same period.</p><p>Mr Trump would love to have his megaphone back. Twitter was his favourite app, a platform he used to drum up support, and dominate the news cycle.</p><p>But while he would have a far greater reach on Twitter, he has a financial interest in making Truth Social succeed. The app is owned by the Trump Media & Technology Group, and if he were to go back to Twitter, it's hard to see how Truth Social could continue.</p><p>That helps to explain why we are not seeing Donald Trump clamouring to come back to Twitter - yet.</p><p>But in the longer term, he will have to weigh up financial decisions with political ones, and with intentions to run for president again - don't rule him out returning.</p>",

The bill will introduce regulation for stable coins - a crypto asset backed by an asset such as a currency - and the marketing of crypto assets.</p><p>Before FTX collapsed, its then-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried took every chance he could to describe his firm as \"the most regulated\" in the industry.</p><p>It's true that FTX had collected dozens of permissions to operate in many countries and to offer many different crypto services.</p><p>But clearly, in the end, those certificates were useless at protecting customers and investors.</p><p>Every time there is a major crisis in crypto the cries for regulation grow, but it's the type of regulation that matters.</p><p>The chief concerns for authorities seem to be about protecting customers from crypto firms going bust and ensuring that they don't run off with people's money.</p><p>But as ever with cryptocurrency there is a tension between safety and freedom.</p><p>Regulating crypto firms to ensure they are safe and responsible entities would bring them a step closer to the traditional financial system - a huge no-no for crypto believers.</p><p>But whatever the true believers want, the FTX chaos may well be the point of no return.</p><p>In his speech, Sir Jon noted that the UK's financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, had been warning for several weeks before FTX's collapse that \"this firm may be providing financial services or products in the UK without our authorisation… you are unlikely to get your money back if things go wrong\".</p><p>FTX did not have a licence to operate in the UK, but its implosion has caused shockwaves around the world.</p><p>The company's filings have revealed that more than one million people and businesses could be owed money following its collapse.</p><p>On Saturday, FTX said it had launched a review of its global assets and was preparing for the sale or reorganisation of some businesses.</p><p>Last week, new FTX chief executive John Ray hit out at the way the failed crypto exchange was run, saying he had never \"seen such a complete failure of corporate controls\".</p><p>Mr Ray, who replaced the company's founder Sam Bankman-Fried, criticised what he called a \"complete absence of trustworthy financial information\".</p><p>Mr Bankman-Fried was one of the crypto world's most high-profile personalities, with the 30-year-old becoming a billionaire in 2021.</p><p>His FTX crypto exchange grew to be the second largest in the world, with $10bn-$15bn traded a day.</p><p>It spent millions on advertising, including during the Superbowl, and last year it acquired the naming rights for the Miami Heat NBA team's arena.</p><p>Mr Bankman-Fried also projected an unconventional approach to business, tweeting pictures of himself sleeping on a beanbag next to his desk in the office.</p><p>Despite the ructions in the crypto world caused by FTX's collapse, Sir Jon said the need for a UK digital currency was still being considered by the Bank of England.</p><p>He said the work on a digital pound was driven by \"the reducing role of cash, and more generally in the increasing digitalisation of daily life\".</p><p>Sir Jon said the Bank planned to issue a consultative report around the end of the year setting out the possible next steps.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Flying taxis appear to be a bit closer to getting off the ground.</p><p>US air regulators on Monday published rules to formally add the machines, which mix characteristics of helicopters and planes, to the list of regulated aircraft.</p><p>The update is necessary before firms can offer flights to customers.</p><p>The move comes as companies have ramped up investments in the new technology, which has been presented as the transport of the future.</p><p>Money has been pouring into the sector, as major airlines place orders and investors bet on a crop of start-ups.</p><p>The new aircraft, also known as electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, can take flight and land without needing a runway, while also travelling long distances like an aeroplane. They also use electric motors, reducing noise and pollution compared to standard planes.</p><p>It has been argued they could help reduce traffic congestion in crowded cities, without being too expensive for customers. They have also been seen as an alternative for transporting cargo.</p><p>In Europe, the industry is hoping to get flying taxis off the ground in time for the 2024 Olympics in Paris.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which has faced industry pressure to clarify the rules for their flight, said on Monday it was proposing to expand its definition of the machines it considered air carriers from airplanes and helicopters, adding \"powered lift\" to the list.</p><p>The agency called its move \"an important step toward making commercial air taxi operations a reality\". The rules now face a period of public comment before they can go into effect.</p><p>\"This powered-lift definitions rule lays the foundation that will allow operators to use powered-lift aircraft,\" it said. \"This is important because our regulations have to cover powered-lift aircraft for them to be able to operate, including commercially.\"</p><p>The agency also said it expected to publish proposed rules for operating such aircraft in summer 2023. Those rules will outline in more detail the criteria that firms will need to meet to licence pilots and launch their operations.</p><p>Walter Desrosier, vice president of engineering and maintenance for the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, called Monday's move an \"absolutely essential first step\" that signals that the FAA is committed to making progress on the topic.</p><p>\"This is very very positive progress, but the details are still to come,\" he said.</p><p>Most analysts in the US do not expect flying taxis to officially lift off until 2024 or 2025 at the earliest, due in part to ongoing debate about how to regulate the new machines, which will run into local regulatory issues as well as ones at a national level.</p><p>Despite the uncertain timeline, United Airlines and Delta are among the major companies that have committed millions of dollars to the idea in recent months. Globally, hundreds of firms are racing for a piece of the action.</p><p>Robin Riedel, a partner at McKinsey and co-leader of the firm's Center for Future Mobility, said many of those companies are likely to fail, pointing to the technical challenge they face, as well as the task of winning public confidence and reducing costs enough to make flying taxis more widely affordable.</p><p>He expects such travel to remain limited to select cities and routes until after 2030, used primarily by ultra-wealthy or business passengers.</p><p>\"Nobody wants to build another toy for the rich - there's a very limited market for that,\" he said. But, he added, \"as a society and as an industry we have to be realistic.\"</p><p>But he said the fact that the FAA is working to include the new aircraft in their regulatory framework may be a sign of a rich future ahead. Regulation of drones, by contrast, has typically happened as companies secure one-off exemptions to existing rules, he said.</p><p>\"The fact that the FAA is going through the trouble of making this regulation is a very encouraging sign that not only is this industry coming but it's big enough and stable enough to justify this kind of rule-making,\" he said.</p>",

The government also offers rent-free land for charging bays.</p><p>First proposed in around 2019, but held-up by the Covid pandemic, the incentives came into effect in April 2021.</p><p>Germany's Volkswagen was one of the first beneficiaries of the government strategy. It launched the e-Golf model in Rwanda in 2019. The pilot project started with four of the cars and two charging stations in Kigali.</p><p>VW's original plan was to expand the service to 50 cars and 15 charging stations, as part of its cab-hailing app called Move.</p><p>However, three years later, only 20 of the cars are on the road and they have been removed from the ride-hailing service. Instead they ferry customers from several high-end hotels, the international airport and the Kigali Convention Centre.</p><p>\"The unevenness in road infrastructure and the height of speed-bumps turned out to be too challenging for the e-Golf, which has a relatively low ground clearance,\" says Allan Kweli, head of operations at Volkswagen Mobility Solutions Rwanda.</p><p>There was particular concern about damaging the underside of the car, where the batteries are located.</p><p>Despite that misfire, VW remains optimistic about Rwanda. It is planning to import its ID.4 electric car, which has a higher ground clearance.</p><p>\"The beauty of Rwanda is that the government has created a test scenario whereby you can prove your work in an African setup,\" Mr Kweli says.</p><p>One glaring problem facing the carmakers is the lack of any charging facilities outside of Kigali.</p><p>In a developing country like Rwanda, it's tough to justify large investments in a nationwide charging infrastructure.</p><p>Nevertheless, in partnership with the government and energy companies, Rwanda's EvPlugin charging network is planning to build 200 public chargers across the country over the next two years.</p><p>Of those facilities, 35 will be suitable for cars while the others will serve electric motorbikes.</p><p>More technology of business:</p><p>Japan's Mitsubishi is dodging the problem by launching a petrol-electric hybrid car in Rwanda.</p><p>It has 135 of its Outlander cars on the roads of Kigali - 90 of which are leased, while the others are driven through a rental service.</p><p>\"A hybrid vehicle eliminates the range anxiety as it can switch to gasoline, which is relevant as we are still far behind with charging infrastructure in Rwanda,\" says Joshua Nshuti, from Greenleaf Motors, Mitsubishi's official dealer in Rwanda.</p><p>He says demand has picked up recently.</p><p>\"As fuel prices have increased by 60% in the last few months, we see a growing demand for the Outlander, as it gives clients the opportunity to half their fuel costs,\" he says.</p><p>Critics question the positive environmental impact of the Outlander as, in hilly Kigali, it can only manage about 50km to 70km (30 to 44 miles) on battery power alone.</p><p>That's not a problem for Paul Frobisher Mugambwa, who works for an international accountancy firm in Kigali. His leased Outlander runs mainly on battery power, for his short 7km commute between his home and the office.</p><p>He says petrol used to cost him $150 (£128) a month, but reckons charging his Outlander costs $40 a month.</p><p>Ideally, he would like to switch to an all-electric car, but worries about the lack of mechanics in Rwanda who would be able to service and mend such a car.</p><p>\"If you buy an imported Chinese electric SUV, who is going to fix your car when it breaks down,\" Mr Mugambwa wonders.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest obstacle to developing an electric car market in Rwanda is the expense.</p><p>Although Rwanda has made economic progress over the last decade, about half the population still meets the UN's definition of poverty - living on less than $2.15 a day.</p><p>While that makes owning an electric vehicle impossible, catching a ride on an electric motorbike is within the realms of possibility.</p><p>The company Ampersand has already managed to sell more than 700 e-motorbikes in Rwanda, where motor taxis are a very important mode of transport.</p><p>These so-called e-motos, with a battery swap system, are extremely popular, partly because they cost less to acquire and operate than a traditional motorbike.</p><p>Despite the challenges, many believe that Rwanda should push on with its electrification plans.</p><p>Michelle DeFreese, is a senior officer at Global Green Growth Institute, which assists the Rwandan government with training and advice regarding a plan for electric public buses.</p><p>She believes that Rwanda, which already produces 53% of its electricity from renewable sources, is in a good position to make the transition.</p><p>\"The combination of transitioning to electric vehicles while investing heavily in renewable and clean energy resources is a powerful combination when it comes to reducing emissions,\" she says.</p>",

It is staffed by academics and lawyers, with the remit of scrutinising and questioning the tech giant's actions.</p><p>The board has now concluded the decision to remove the song from Instagram was wrong because the threat of violence was not credible. It says the track must be reinstated.</p><p>It also says there are serious concerns that drill - which is particularly popular among young black Britons - is being overpoliced.</p><p>Chinx (OS) told the BBC he was pleased the video would be restored and had not understood why it had been taken down in the first place.</p><p>He said he did \"not believe\" that his music would incite violence.</p><p>\"I can see why people think it's very violent but I feel like it's an expression,\" he said.</p><p>\"I think people are involved in a certain lifestyle prior to them releasing drill music.</p><p>\"I don't think you release drill music then find yourself in gang activities - I feel it's the other way around.\"</p><p>The board called on Meta to create a \"globally consistent system\" for content removal requests from official bodies - emphasising \"not every piece of content that law enforcement would prefer to have taken down should be taken down\".</p><p>\"It is therefore critical that Meta evaluates these requests independently, particularly when they relate to artistic expression from individuals in minority or marginalised groups for whom the risk of cultural bias against their content is acute.\"</p><p>As part of its investigation, Meta's Oversight Board said it filed multiple freedom of information requests with the Met Police.</p><p>It said it found the force had filed 286 requests with social media and streaming companies to take down or review posts about drill music in the 12 months from June 2021, and that 255 of those had resulted in the removal of content.</p><p>Over the same period, it had not made a single request to remove any other music genre, the force said.</p><p>A Meta spokesperson said: \"We do not remove content simply because law enforcement requests it - we take action if content is found to violate our policies or local law.</p><p>\"As part of our robust review process, we assess whether a request is consistent with internationally-recognized standards on human rights, including due process, privacy, free expression and the rule of law.\"</p><p>The Metropolitan Police has been approached for comment.</p><p>Steven Keogh, a former detective with the Metropolitan Police, told the BBC that in his experience of investigating gang-related murders in London \"all bar none\" had \"some connection\" to drill tracks.</p><p>\"The police aren't going to take down all drill music, it's not a war against drill music,\" he said.</p><p>\"It's specific intelligence about specific videos that they think could lead to problems.\"</p>",

        "content": "<p>Layoffs across the tech industry, including at firms like Twitter, Meta and Amazon, have affected a significant number of Indians working in the US who are on visas like the H-1B. California-based journalist Savita Patel speaks to workers who are facing the prospect of being forced to return to India if they don't find another job.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta, an Indian engineer working in the US since 2009, was surprised that she was laid off by Meta this month. \"I was performing well at work,\" she says.</p><p>On 9 November, Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, announced it would cut 13% of its workforce - the first mass lay-offs in the firm's history which resulted in 11,000 employees losing their jobs.</p><p>\"None of us slept that night,\" Ms Gupta says. \"At 6am, I got the email. I couldn't access my computer, nor the office gym. It felt like a break-up.\"</p><p>Ms Gupta is likely to be a familiar face for Indians. Winner of the 2018 Miss Bharat-California contest, she was featured most recently in the Netflix show Indian Matchmaking.</p><p>Now she is among thousands of educated and skilled immigrant workers fired by US tech companies this month.</p><p>Most of them work in the US because of the HI-B visa. It's a non-immigrant visa that allows firms to employ foreigners for up to six years in positions for which they have been unable to find American employees.</p><p>It also allows holders to apply for permanent residency in the US and buy property in the country.</p><p>Ms Gupta says she worked very hard to build a life in the US for \"over 15 years\".</p><p>Her visa now hinges on finding her next job.</p><p>Worldwide, more than 120,000 tech workers have lost jobs as a result of cutbacks by US tech companies, according to the Layoffs.fyi website, which tracks tech job cuts.</p><p>While companies have not released India-specific numbers, San Jose-based immigration attorney Swati Khandelwal says \"it's hurt the Indian community particularly hard.\"</p><p>\"We saw an uptick in calls for consultation,\" she says. \"Everybody is anxious, even those who have not been laid off fear that they might be [fired] later.\"</p><p>For Indian tech workers, the layoffs do not just mean seeking new employment but also finding employers who are willing help them continue with their work and pay for the associated legal costs.</p><p>\"If a new employer is unable to transfer your visa petition in 60 days, the remedy is for people to leave [the US] and re-enter for work after the paperwork is complete,\" Ms Khandelwal says.</p><p>\"But the practical aspect is that people will get stuck in India as there are not many visa stamping appointments available in consulates,\" she says.</p><p>Wait times for a visa appointment at US consulates in India have reached 800 days in some cases.</p><p>This is why the layoffs have come as an unwelcome surprise for Indian workers.</p><p>Sowmya Iyer, a lead product designer at the ride-sharing app Lyft, says she was part of a team that \"had internally taken steps to maintain the fiscal health of the company\".</p><p>But Ms Iyer found herself among hundreds who were laid off at the company this month. \"We had not expected it to hit us,\" she says.</p><p>The mass layoffs feel like a \"tech pandemic,\" she explains. \"Both my friend and his wife lost their jobs on the same day. Everyone is in the same boat - reaching out, exchanging condolences.\"</p><p>Ms Iyer says she has student loans to pay back and hasn't told her parents back home in the western Indian state of Gujarat about her layoff.</p><p>In the US on an O-1 visa - granted to individuals with \"extraordinary ability and achievement\" - Ms Iyer says she is confident of finding work.</p><p>Her resume lists degrees from prestigious design schools in India and the US and the O-1 visa allows her to stay on for 60 days after the termination of any job.</p><p>America's WARN (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification) Act offers a buffer before the 60-day visa clock starts. WARN requires employers to give a 60-day notice to the affected employees during a mass layoff.</p><p>\"To ensure my status here and help me find an employer, my former employers have given me a month's notice, so currently I have three months,\" she says.</p><p>But for many Indians, even 90 days is a tight timeline and has upended plans they had. Many have families to support, others have thousands of dollars in loans to pay off.</p><p>Naman Kapoor had borrowed money to pay for his masters programme at New York University.</p><p>He was hired as an engineer by Meta after multiple rounds of interview only to be laid off seven weeks later. \"I got the termination email at 8am [local time] on 9 November,\" he says.</p><p>\"The whole idea is that a US education includes work experience,\" he says. \"It is very expensive to study in New York. I worked to support my living expenses.\"</p><p>Mr Kapoor is in the US on an F-1 (OPT) visa which allows him only 90 days of unemployment during his stay in country.</p><p>\"Meta offered me four months of pay as severance,\" Mr Kapoor explains. \"But I have just three months within which I must find my next job or go back!\"</p><p>Finding a new job in this environment will be tough, Ms Gupta says. \"It's almost December - hiring will be slow because of the holidays.\"</p><p>In the wake of the layoffs, Ms Khandelwal says a community has formed to support people in crisis. Colleagues and employers have been spreading information and offering referrals for prospects online.</p><p>\"I created Zeno, [a platform] to help the impacted (workers) find jobs,\" says Abhishek Gutgutia, a tech worker based in the Bay Area. \"It has seen 15,000 visits so far.\"</p><p>Mr Gutgutia says his LinkedIn post on Zeno has nearly 600,000 views. \"About 100 candidates, 25 companies and 30 mentors have signed up. Several immigration attorneys have also volunteered [their services].\"</p><p>Vidya Srinivasan, a Meta employee, says she saw a \"heart-warming outpouring of support from Meta-mates\" in her efforts to put together a \"Meta Alumni guide\" for those whose lives changed overnight. Her online posts were seen by over a million people, she says.</p><p>Amid such hopes, Indian immigrant workers remain on tenterhooks until they land their next job.</p><p>\"I am tired of being tested,\" Ms Gupta says. \"How much stronger should I be?\".</p>",

They said the messages would direct victims to the Metropolitan Police website which would ask people to register with Action Fraud. Any other texts should be regarded as fraudulent themselves.</p><p>The mammoth cyber fraud operation began when police in the Netherlands bugged a website that allowed fraudsters to make anonymous phone calls from spoof numbers, posing as bank employees.</p><p>The iSpoof website, which has since been taken down by the FBI, crucially allowed scammers to access one-time passcodes and passwords, detectives said.</p><p>One-time codes, often delivered through text messages, have become a standard security measure for most online banks in recent years.</p><p>Det Supt Helen Rance, from the Met's Cyber Crime unit, said victims would not have known the phone call was coming from iSpoof.</p><p>\"The person on the other end of the line can be very convincing,\" she said.</p><p>\"This is an absolutely devastating crime for so many people. They must be worried, I really feel for them,\" she said.</p><p>Fraudsters paid between £150 and £5,000 a month in bitcoin to use the iSpoof service, contacting, at times, 20 people a minute, primarily in the USA, UK, Netherlands, Australia, France and Ireland.</p><p>So far, police believe £48m may have been stolen by criminals using iSpoof. This figure is likely to rise. Those behind the service are allegedly earning £3.2m and living \"lavish\" lifestyles.</p><p>A notice on the website says that it has been taken down by the FBI.</p><p>Det Supt Rance said the investigation remained active.</p><p>Police believe 59,000 potential suspects may have used the iSpoof service, but are prioritising those in the UK who have spent at least 100 Bitcoin to get access, believing they were anonymous.</p><p>Early in November they raided an address in east London and arrested a man alleged to be behind iSpoof.</p><p>In other raids, 120 people thought to have used the service for fraud have been taken into custody.</p><p>Det Supt Rance warned other criminal \"enablers\" will have taken over to provide services to fraudsters.</p><p>\"Undoubtedly they will go to another website,\" she said.</p><p>A 34-year-old man, Teejai Fletcher, has been charged with making or supplying articles for use in fraud and participating in the activities of an organised crime group.</p><p>He will appear at Southwark Crown Court on 6 December.</p><p>Call your bank directly, checking its website for the correct number to ring. If the fraud involved any of your personal information, consider signing up for a Protective Registration with fraud prevention organisation Cifas, which costs £25 for two years.</p><p>Change your passwords for any accounts that have been compromised due to fraud - and any that use the same password. Set up two-factor authentication wherever possible to provide another layer of protection.</p><p>Being scammed can take a huge toll on mental health. Mind and Victim Support have confidential helplines that provide support to consumers who have been hit.</p><p>Do you believe you've been scammed by fake callers? Have you received a notification of fraud from the police? Share your experiences by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.</p><p>Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist. You can also get in touch in the following ways:</p><p>If you are reading this page and can't see the form you will need to visit the mobile version of the BBC website to submit your question or comment or you can email us at HaveYourSay@bbc.co.uk.

I just thought that I was being greedy.\"</p><p>According to eating disorder charity Beat, BED is a mental health condition where people eat large quantities of food without feeling like they're in control of what they're doing.</p><p>The charity worked with Zara and BBC Three to produce Disordered Eating.</p><p>Watching the documentary, Amy says she \"felt like my story was being told\".</p><p>Katie McKenzie feels raising awareness of disordered eating is important because \"it's actually a lot more common than eating disorders themselves as diagnosable conditions\".</p><p>\"The documentary showed quite a few people had slipped into a disorder via disordered eating,\" the 24-year-old from Wigan says, adding the more that people can be aware of the early signs, the sooner they can get help.</p><p>Like Amy, Katie says the documentary will help people feel like they're not alone if they have an eating disorder.</p><p>Beat estimates that more than a million people in the UK live with an eating disorder and it says there has been an increase since the Covid lockdowns.</p><p>\"It really hit home how many young people are struggling with disordered eating across the spectrum, from disordered eating into a more severe eating disorder,\" Zara told BBC Newsbeat.</p><p>She wanted to make the film to step outside what is \"comfortable to talk about\" and explore a variety of eating disorders.</p><p>Katie, who's in her fourth year studying medicine at the University of Liverpool, was diagnosed with anorexia and bulimia in 2016.</p><p>\"It's something that is hard to talk about,\" Katie says. \"The actual illness itself is very secretive.</p><p>\"By having it as more of a common conversation and people being more open about it, hopefully more people will be feeling comfortable in starting those conversations.\"</p><p>In the film, Zara also opens up about her concerns about whether she was influencing her followers in a negative way by sharing her meals and exercise routines.</p><p>\"I went on a massive journey, looking at my own influence,\" she says.</p><p>\"I think a lot of us with social media followings have triggered someone in some way at some point so it's really important for me to take accountability.\"</p><p>Amy says Zara calling out her own actions was \"really brave\".</p><p>She also has an Instagram account which she uses to chart her recovery, sharing her own exercise routines, recipes and weight loss updates.</p><p>\"I was thinking, 'am I also part of the problem?',\" Amy says.</p><p>\"I'm saying to people I have an eating disorder and I'm trying to get better but then I'm posting all this stuff.\"</p><p>Beat praises the way Zara tackled the influence of social media.</p><p>\"Eating disorder content, for instance posts about extreme weight loss or specific behaviours, can harm those with or vulnerable to developing an eating disorder,\" said Tom Quinn from the charity.</p><p>\"However, it's important to remember that the relationship between social media and eating disorders is complex.\"</p><p>Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.</p><p>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Software firm boss Stanford Mogotsi says he remains committed to South Africa, despite the challenges of running a small IT firm in the country.</p><p>\"It's my home, I have a kid, I have a family here,\" says the 47-year-old.</p><p>Mr Mogotsi co-owns Johannesburg-based software company Nane Solutions with his friend and business partner Kabelo Mashishi, 44.</p><p>Both have come a long way since growing up in one of South Africa's townships during apartheid.</p><p>Each studied computer science at university, and then spent a number of years in corporate IT jobs, before launching Nane in 2006.</p><p>Their initial work was consultancy - advising firms such as MTN, South Africa's largest mobile phone network, and state-owned power company Eskom.</p><p>But they found consulting frustrating because they wanted to build software from the ground up, rather than just advise.</p><p>Their first major foray into designing software was creating a system for world football governing body Fifa to manage volunteers at the 2010 World Cup, which was held in South Africa.</p><p>Then in 2017 they created software that helped brewing group Heineken improve its transportation system in the country. Another big project win was developing an app for phone service Talk360.</p><p>Yet it hasn't all been plain sailing for the firm. Nane means eight in Swahili, and the name was chosen because the company had eight founders.</p><p>However, the shift from consulting to the risker business of software development, and then the impact of South Africa's tough coronavirus lockdowns, resulted in all but Mr Mogotsi and Mr Mashisi leaving the business.</p><p>\"It's really difficult to win work when you are a small firm,\" says Mr Mogotsi. \"We have to compete with multinationals, and potential clients tend to want to go for these tried and tested big IT firms, especially when the economic backdrop in South Africa is uncertain.\"</p><p>Prof Duncan Coulter, head of the Academy of Computer Science and Software Engineering at the University of Johannesburg, agrees that times are difficult for South African IT companies like Nane.</p><p>While Mr Mogotsi and Mr Mashisi are staying in South Africa, Prof Coulter says that the continuing big problem for the country's IT sector is a brain drain - people finding jobs overseas.</p><p>\"A lot of our better students are now off in Europe, America and Asia, are doing very well for themselves, we're very proud of them,\" he says.</p><p>\"And as part of the general brain drain [away from South Africa], they definitely have opportunities to move more easily than professions like lawyer and doctors.\"</p><p>As a result of all these young IT professionals finding work overseas, Prof Coulter says that firms in the sector in South Africa can now struggle to fill positions.</p><p>Mr Mashisi says that \"salary-wise we can't compete\" with what large firms overseas can offer. \"So as soon as someone's got a year or two's worth of experience, then it's easy for them to be snapped up [and go abroad].\"</p><p>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.</p><p>Yet despite this brain drain, South Africa still has successful software start-ups that are producing popular products.</p><p>An example of this is the app EskomSePush, which warns users across South Africa when to expect power cuts.</p><p>Such power cuts or \"load-sheddings\" are a regular occurrence in the country, due to the continuing energy generation shortfalls at power firm Eskom.</p><p>Sometimes people have to go without power for 10 hours a day, and there's no end in sight, with shortfalls due to continue until 2027.</p><p>EskomSePush is the brainchild of co-founders Dan Wells (35) and Herman Maritz, who launched the app in 2015 and run it from their Cape Town homes.</p><p>It collects and processes complicated load-shedding schedules from Eskom and local governments across South Africa. Notifications are then sent out to the app's users telling them exactly when the power will be out in their neighbourhood and for how long.</p><p>Mr Wells says that within six months of launching the app 250,000 people had downloaded it, \"which was crazy back then\".</p><p>He adds that today the app is \"on seven million devices, and about a million people will click on a notification almost immediately\".</p><p>The app is monetised through advertising revenues, and Mr Wells' advise for software developers is \"gain a taste for having problems, find your community and solve some problems\".</p><p>If there is one thing that unites South Africans it is a love of sport, with cricket being the third most popular in the country.</p><p>At the University of Johannesburg, computer science lecturer Tevin Moodley and Prof Dustin van der Haar, have developed a cricket video software system that aims to help produce the next generation of world-beating South African batsmen and women.</p><p>Its software can automatically identify the different strokes played by a particular batsman from a recording of a test match or other game.</p><p>This means that a cricket coach can play numerous clips of a certain shot, without having to laboriously go through all the footage to first find them.</p><p>This allows quick analysis of the player's execution of the shot in question, where they are standing, and their foot placements. From that, recommendations and improvements can be made, and young players can compare their performance with video recordings of former cricketing greats.</p><p>\"My belief is if you're able to improve the batter's skill level, you're able to improve your team's chances of winning,\" says Mr Moodley. \"So the impact of our work will be very big within the space of cricket.\"</p><p>At the moment, Mr Moodley uses YouTube clips of test matches to collect footage, but he hopes to work with Cricket South Africa to secure more videos.</p><p>While the software is currently still in the research stage, Mr Moodley says that given the right investors and stakeholders he would look to build a commercial product.</p><p>But in the meantime his focus is trying to help the next generation of South African cricketers. \"I want to keep it local and try to help our team,\" he says.</p>",

        "slug": "holiday-swindlers-the-rise-of-digital-travel-scams",
        "content": "<p>Digital travel scams are a growing \"systemic and global\" problem, according to the World Tourism Organization, a branch of the UN. Dozens of Brazilian women have been finding this out the hard way, after paying for luxury holidays from a man whose Instagram account sparkles with opulent hotels and exotic locations.</p><p>Last December Maria (not her real name) decided to have a break from the heat of the Australian summer, and to take her family on a skiing holiday to Europe.</p><p>It was her first trip since the pandemic and she wanted it to be special. So she paid $20,000 to a travel agent, Rafael Bessa, a fellow Brazilian who had been recommended by a friend, and made the long flight north.</p><p>To begin with, everything was perfect, but as Maria checked out of the third hotel the manager told her the room had not been paid for.</p><p>Two further shocks came in quick succession. When Maria contacted Rafael Bessa to ask for help, she noticed he was unable to talk to the hotel manager in French, despite his claim to have attended an exclusive boarding school in the Alps. Then, when the family boarded a train to their next destination, there was a problem with the tickets: he had provided two tickets with the same purchase number, meaning that only one was valid.</p><p>At the next hotel it was a similar story: Maria had to settle the bill, even though she had paid in full already.</p><p>Initially she had assumed Rafael Bessa was simply incompetent. \"Then I said, 'No, this is not a mistake, this is on purpose. This is in bad faith.'\"</p><p>Altogether, Maria says she lost $30,000 on the holiday - $15,000 of the money she had paid in advance, plus an extra $15,000 for just one of the hotels. Maria says that as well as telling her he'd paid for the room, Rafael Bessa said he'd got her a free upgrade - but he hadn't, and the hotel charged the staggering full price for the super de luxe room.</p><p>Rafael Bessa's promises of reimbursement came to nothing, Maria says. Although he sent her various \"proofs\" of money transfers, the cash never actually arrived in her account.</p><p>Then, when she posted about her experiences on social media, she says his lawyer got in touch, offering to reimburse $20,000 as long as she signed a non-disclosure agreement. She refused.</p><p>The BBC asked Rafael Bessa to comment on Maria's allegations. He replied that there had been an unspecified \"problem\" with the price of one of the hotels, and that the room at this price had not been included in the package. He also sent copies of the train bookings - which, as Maria said, both bore the same purchase number.</p><p>Another Brazilian woman, Ana Jalenna, booked an Alpine skiing trip and also an Italian summer holiday with Rafael Bessa, after he had organised a \"fantastic\" family holiday for her in Brazil.</p><p>She paid part of the bill in cash, and the plan was that he would put the rest on her credit card. Some time later, she was surprised to see a payment to British Airways appear on her card account and called him to ask about it.</p><p>It was the payment for her Italian hotel, he told her. Finding this hard to believe, she emailed the hotel and was told no payment had been made.</p><p>Ana decided to ask Rafael Bessa for proof that he had at least made the bookings at the ski resort. He gave her two reservation numbers, but the hotel told her they were invalid.</p><p>\"I lost the money, the dream, the trip. I lost everything,\" she says.</p><p>She later spoke to other dissatisfied clients of Rafael Bessa's, and noticed a pattern.</p><p>\"The first trip was fantastic and everything is OK,\" she says. \"And then he does a longer trip, a better trip with expensive hotels, and he does this to people.\"</p><p>Rafael Bessa insisted to the BBC that he booked the Italian hotel. He said Ana cancelled the skiing trip, and he paid her back the money.</p><p>But Ana said she didn't cancel it - and wasn't reimbursed.</p><p>The Holiday Swindler: The rise of digital travel scams</p><p>Social media is tempting people to sample the luxury holiday lifestyle, but what happens when it all goes wrong? This is the story of one Brazilian travel agent with a trail of unhappy clients around the world.</p><p>Watch on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)</p><p>Maria and Ana were angry and scarred by their experience, but neither suffered financial hardship as a result.</p><p>For Adriane Trofin, a Brazilian working mother of two who lives in London, the failure of her dream family holiday to Greece this year was more traumatic.</p><p>She first came across Rafael Bessa on Facebook, captivated by his posts from beautiful locations, and struck up an online friendship.</p><p>She explained that she couldn't afford that kind of holiday herself, but he replied that there were trips for every budget, and she ended up booking a dream holiday to Greece for 14 people in total - members of her family and a number of friends.</p><p>They had paid Rafael Bessa in advance for the stay at a four-star Club Med resort, but the cars that should have met them at Athens airport didn't arrive.</p><p>Adriane messaged Rafael Bessa for help. He reassured her that everything had been booked, and gave her three telephone numbers for the car company, but she couldn't get through on any of them.</p><p>The group was stranded for hours. Eventually, the airport operations manager for Club Med, David Doepfer, came to their assistance. He quickly established that there was no Club Med booking in Adriane's name. Rafael Bessa had once reserved rooms, he learned, but had not paid for them before the expiry date.</p><p>David called the travel agent and asked him to book a different hotel in Athens for the group, which he agreed to do. But David says that when he called the new hotel to check Rafael Bessa had stuck to his word he was told the rooms had not been paid for.</p><p>In the end Adriane's husband paid for the entire group to stay in another hotel, at a cost of $8,500.</p><p>\"I spent that week, those seven days, discussing with Rafael day and night on the phone, trying to make him send at least a part of the money. He started to mock me,\" Adriane says. He also harassed other members of the group, she says, convincing some of them that the problem was Adriane's fault and that she owed him money.</p><p>\"I was in hell. I had never faced a worse situation in my life, I never had anything worse in my life than those seven days in Greece.</p><p>\"My marriage is still badly shaken by that. For me, it's a lot of money, you see? But it's no longer just about the money.\"</p><p>She says the experience left her \"emotionally destroyed\".</p><p>Despite having assured Adriane, as she waited at the airport, that everything would be fine, Rafael Bessa told the BBC he had cancelled the hotel booking because Adriane had failed to pay everything she owed him.</p><p>But Adriane showed the BBC evidence of money transfers made before the trip covering the full cost of the hotel. She had agreed with Rafael Bessa to pay for three plane tickets in instalments, and was up to date with these payments - which Mr Bessa confirmed in screengrabs of messages he sent to the BBC.</p><p>The BBC has spoken to 10 other clients of Rafael Bessa.

        "content": "<p>China has recorded its highest number of daily Covid cases since the pandemic began, despite stringent measures designed to eliminate the virus.</p><p>Several major cities including the capital Beijing and southern trade hub Guangzhou are experiencing outbreaks.</p><p>Wednesday saw 31,527 cases recorded compared with an April peak of 28,000.</p><p>The numbers are still tiny for a country of 1.4 billion people and officially just over 5,200 have died since the pandemic began.</p><p>That equates to three Covid deaths in every million in China, compared with 3,000 per million in the US and 2,400 per million in the UK, although direct comparisons between countries are difficult.</p><p>While China's zero-Covid policy has clearly saved lives, it has also dealt a punishing blow to the economy and ordinary people's lives.</p><p>The country slightly relaxed some of those restrictions a few weeks ago.</p><p>It cut quarantine for close contacts from seven days in a state facility to five days and three days at home, and stopped recording secondary contacts which allowed many more people to avoid having to quarantine.</p><p>Officials have also sought to avoid enforcing blanket lockdowns of the kind endured by the largest city, Shanghai, earlier this year.</p><p>But faced with a renewed surge in cases in Beijing, as well as the first deaths from the virus in months, officials have already implemented some restrictions in several districts, with shops, schools and restaurants closed.</p><p>The central city of Zhengzhou is also to enforce an effective lockdown for 6 million residents from Friday, officials announced.</p><p>It follows violent protests at a vast industrial complex belonging to iPhone manufacturer Foxconn. The firm has apologised for a \"technical error\" in its payment systems.</p><p>Other stories of suffering and desperation have been shared online where they have fuelled public resentment.</p><p>Last week, reports that a baby in Zhengzhou died because her medical care was delayed by Covid restrictions prompted a huge outcry.</p><p>Among some of the most severe responses to Covid this year:</p><p>The word came suddenly last night that our housing compound would be locked down with all residents confined to their homes.</p><p>This is not a surprise in China anymore. At any point, a single infection or being linked to an infection can mean not being allowed out.</p><p>Beijing is in the middle of a major Covid outbreak but, even before then, visiting a shopping mall or a building where an infected person had been meant going into home quarantine.</p><p>Right now, in the capital's vast Chaoyang district most businesses are closed. In thousands of tower blocks, all residents have been ordered to remain indoors for the next few days initially.</p><p>Then consider that this is being replicated in cities right across the country.</p><p>In the regions of Xinjiang and Tibet, the lockdowns have gone on for months.</p><p>At the beginning of 2023, this country will be heading into its fourth year of this crisis and, whether it is true or not, zero-Covid has a never-ending feeling to it.</p><p>People are completely worn out by the pandemic and the government's economy-destroying response to it.</p><p>That officials have not explained where the off ramp is, has only added to the uncertainty.</p><p>Scientists here can also see that China's vaccination rates are way too low, especially amongst vulnerable groups. What is more, not enough resources have been diverted into expanding medical facilities to cope with a massive influx of patients following any opening-up.</p><p>In the short term though, my compound has now told me that, after several rounds of mass testing, we are allowed to leave.</p><p>For most residents this will not make much difference though because hardly anything outside is open, including their workplaces.</p><p>China is the last major economy still pursuing a Covid eradication process with mass testing and lockdown rules, and virus cases are being recorded in 31 provinces.</p><p>Part of the reason is that vaccination levels are lower than in other developed nations, and only half of people aged over 80 have their primary vaccinations.</p><p>China has refused to import vaccines despite evidence that its homemade jabs have not proved as effective.</p><p>President Xi Jinping argues that strict curbs are needed to protect the country's large elderly population.</p><p>Zero-Covid has come to define his rule and the authoritarian bureaucracy at his disposal like almost no other policy.</p><p>It projects a veneer of control and stability in the run-up to March when China's equivalent of a parliament will convene to choose Mr Xi as president for a third time.</p><p>\"Lockdowns prevent Covid outbreaks from spreading,\" William Hurst, professor of Chinese development at Cambridge University, told BBC News recently. \"But they also exert incredibly strict social control.\"</p>",

The move would bring it in line with an earlier law against \"upskirting\".</p><p>Announcing the measures, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said the government accepted there were gaps in the law and it needed to adapt to the changing use of technology.</p><p>He said he wanted to \"give women and girls the confidence that the justice system is on their side and will really come down like a ton of bricks on those who abuse or intimidate them\".</p><p>Ayesha - not her real name - told Panorama in August how videos secretly filmed by a partner and faked images of her were being shared on Reddit, driving her to try to take her own life.</p><p>She told the BBC that the new announcement gave her hope that police could take action and the harassment she experienced would finally end.</p><p>\"It will make a massive change to my life and to many other lives as well. We'll be actually able to live and to breathe in peace without having to be scared,\" she said.</p><p>Kate Isaacs, who told a BBC documentary last month how she was targeted by deepfake creators after campaigning against non-consensual porn, says tackling the issue requires more than a change in the law.</p><p>\"I think it's deeply rooted in society at this point. We don't have time. The technology is running 1,000 miles quicker than we are,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday.</p><p>She said even for an seasoned campaigner on this issue, having her own image and her identity violated by deepfakers had been a frightening experience.</p><p>\"I had given advice to so many survivors on what you should do if you become a victim of this crime. But I just froze, and didn't follow any of my own advice. I think it was just too scary to comprehend and process at the time,\" she said.</p><p>One deepfake porn creator told the BBC earlier this year that the risk of prosecution could make him stop.</p><p>\"If I could be traced online I would stop there and probably find another hobby,\" he said.</p><p>The Ministry of Justice also said it was looking at whether it could give the victims of intimate image abuse the same anonymity as the victims of sexual offences are granted, in line with the Law Commission's recommendations.</p><p>Prof Clare McGlynn at Durham University, an expert in image-based sexual abuse, told the BBC the changes were \"a testament to the courage of women who have been speaking up\", but added that it was \"absolutely vital that anonymity is granted immediately\".</p><p>\"Victims tell us that not being able to be anonymous means they are more reluctant to report to the police and it means cases are more often dropped,\" she said.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Funky green chairs. Dark wood for the desks - no white melamine, definitely not. And it has to be wheelchair-friendly.</p><p>That's what Jane Brearley, chief executive and founder of start-up Intent Health, had in mind when she was setting up her firm's new office in central London.</p><p>Accessibility and aesthetics were key - but it didn't matter if the desks and chairs had already been used by someone else. That just meant they came at a bargain price.</p><p>\"I probably saved about 19, 20 grand by kitting out with second-hand furniture,\" she says.</p><p>The pandemic caused a huge shift in working practices. While some have fully embraced working from home, others are returning to the office, perhaps part-time. As a result, many companies are downsizing central offices and that means a glut of second-hand desks, chairs and filing cabinets is available to those who want them.</p><p>In Dr Brearley's case, the new office is sometimes empty since her staff choose to work from home much of the time - but she argues it's worth having anyway.</p><p>\"I have young people on the team who are working out of their bedroom or from their kitchen in a flat share, it's really important that they have a place they can go,\" she explains, adding that the office is useful for training, too.</p><p>Some of Dr Brearley's colleagues use wheelchairs so it was important to find furniture that would meet everyone's needs and also allow for plenty of space in the office.</p><p>She was able to source desks, chairs, meeting room equipment and personal lockers from multiple second-hand suppliers. The only thing she struggled to find was sofas, so those came new.</p><p>A wide variety of organisations are in the market for second-hand office furniture these days. Even former Prime Minister Liz Truss turned to pre-used kit for her campaign office, according to the firm that says it was the supplier.</p><p>Besides cost, organisations are also attracted by the idea that re-using furniture is more environmentally friendly, on the whole, than buying it new, says Adrian Preston, managing director of WantDontWant.com.</p><p>\"There's so much in the news about reusing, recycling now. They want to be seen to be doing the right thing,\" he explains.</p><p>Mr Preston's firm brokers the sale of second-hand furniture between his clients and the companies that are offloading it, rather than stocking large volumes himself. However, one thing he never bothers with is window blinds: \"They're a nightmare because they're bespoke to the windows they come from and they're dusty, dirty and grubby.\"</p><p>More technology of business:</p><p>Simon Ward, sales manager at CK Office Furniture says, \"We're seeing companies downsizing because of the new working practices, reducing square footage of their offices and therefore trying to clear furniture.\"</p><p>It means his firm has the pick of the quality it wants, he adds, noting that second-hand stock is particularly popular with home workers and small firms or start-ups.</p><p>The market is certainly very active at the moment, says Karl Ward - no relation - managing director of ORS, another second-hand furniture retailer: \"We've just had the busiest quarter we've ever had, by quite some distance.\"</p><p>There is sometimes a long wait for new furniture, and this has been a particular problem during the pandemic, he notes.</p><p>\"I've got about 4,500 desks in stock,\" says Mr Ward. \"If companies want 50 or 60 chairs and they want them tomorrow, they can have them tomorrow.\"</p><p>Retailers who spoke to the BBC suggested that the most popular items tend to be desks, chairs and filing cabinets. But you can be more imaginative, if you want.</p><p>Mr Ward of ORS mentions that a few months ago he sold a luxury six-by-two metre marble boardroom table, which he says was \"the best boardroom table I've ever seen\". Brand new it would have cost £65,000, he estimates. A customer took it for £22,000.</p><p>Mr Preston has also shifted some unusual items - including a climbing wall and 100 biscuit tins shaped like Stormtrooper helmets from Star Wars. \"I bought four of those for my office as well,\" he adds.</p><p>While some second-hand furniture comes in great condition, it does occasionally require refurbishment as well. Sam Coggin, company director of The Coggin Group says his company specialises in this.</p><p>With tired office chairs, for example, his team can replace stiff casters or worn-out gas lifts, the devices that allow people to adjust the height of a chair seat. Mr Coggin and his colleagues can also repaint legwork on desks or cut them down to a smaller size and refinish them.</p><p>Currently, the firm is resizing around 200 desks for one client who found they were too big for their office.</p><p>The idea is to keep as much of the item in use as possible and process any removed materials for recycling - including plastics, metals and foam.</p><p>\"If we can keep 80 to 90% of the product original and just replace parts that wear down… it does bring them back to a like-new standard,\" says Mr Coggin.</p><p>Someone who turned to second-hand furniture with a very specific purchase in mind, and found what she wanted, is Liana Fricker, founder of accelerator The Inspiration Space.</p><p>When her husband's firm sent a well-engineered office chair to their house during the pandemic, she realised it was exactly what she wanted - very comfortable and good for her back, too.</p><p>She soon found the same model second-hand online and snapped it up.</p><p>\"I picked up a chair that would have cost me about £1,500 for like £460,\" she says. Delivery was included, too.</p><p>Besides enjoying the process of hunting for the chair she wanted, she adds that she appreciates the opportunity to contribute to the circular economy - where products are re-used or recycled wherever possible.</p><p>\"It boils down to the environment,\" she says.</p><p>\"If we're buying second-hand goods, we'll send a signal to the market that we don't want cheap, disposable items anymore.\"</p>",

        "slug": "why-donald-trump-isn-t-returning-to-twitter-for-now",
        "content": "<p>Donald Trump loves Twitter.</p><p>In 2017, he said he wouldn't have become president without it.</p><p>\"Twitter is a wonderful thing for me, because I get the word out… I might not be here talking to you right now as president if I didn't have an honest way of getting the word out,\" he said.</p><p>After Twitter's new owner Elon Musk reversed Mr Trump's permanent suspension, you might have thought the former president would jump at the chance to come back. But so far, he hasn't taken up that offer.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Well, only Donald Trump knows the answer to that question for sure.</p><p>But what we do know is he has a lot of money to lose from tweeting.</p><p>\"The simplest explanation is the most likely - it's about money,\" says Josh Tucker, professor of politics at New York University (NYU).</p><p>After Donald Trump was kicked off Twitter, he created his own social media platform called Truth Social - that looks an awful lot like Twitter.</p><p>To understand the financial bind Donald Trump is in, you have to understand the complex nature of Truth Social's business set up.</p><p>Last year, the private company that owns Truth Social, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), announced its intention to merge with a shell company trading on the stock exchange called Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC).</p><p>DWAC is what's known as a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (Spac). Spacs are hyped as a way to speed up the often slow process of taking a private company public. In simple terms, it means merging a company that isn't on a stock exchange with one that is.</p><p>Both TMTG and DWAC have agreed to merge, though the deal has not yet been completed. But that hasn't stopped investors piling money into DWAC - all of them speculating that the deal will go through. The shell company is currently valued at more than $800m (£665m).</p><p>Considering DWAC would only be acquiring about a quarter of TMTG, Mr Trump's newly merged company would be worth at least $3-4bn, says Michael Ohlrogge, an academic specialising in Spacs.</p><p>\"He would own the vast majority. He would own probably 70 or 80% of it.\"</p><p>If it all goes through, it would make this business venture one of the most successful of Donald Trump's career.</p><p>But the key to keeping stock value high is making sure that the former president stays on Truth Social - and exclusively so.</p><p>It's hard to see what Truth Social has going for it without Donald Trump. The social media company was created by him. Why should even his supporters use the platform if he is posting elsewhere?</p><p>Truth Social is already struggling to attract users. Analytics firm Similar Web estimates the platform had eight million site visits in September 2022 - down from 11.5 million in July. For a social media company, that is tiny.</p><p>Similar Web estimates that Twitter had nine billion site visits in September.</p><p>If Donald Trump were to stop posting, or do it elsewhere, he could potentially tank the share price of DWAC, wiping hundreds of millions of dollars off its value.</p><p>So important was Donald Trump's exclusivity with Truth Social to the proposed merger with DWAC, that a legal provision was placed in the agreement.</p><p>It states that \"President Trump is generally obligated to make any social media post on Truth Social and may not make the same post on another social media site for 6 hours.\"</p><p>It means that not only could Donald Trump lose a lot of money by using Twitter (by spooking investors) but he could also get sued.</p><p>\"It's hard to say for sure who would win, but it wouldn't be a completely crazy suit to try to bring,\" says Ohlrogge.</p><p>It means Donald Trump is now in a quandary. He might want to go back to Twitter. But he is financially - not to mention legally - incentivised not to.</p><p>There are, however, other factors at play that could lead to him tweeting once more.</p><p>For starters, DWAC's share price has behaved in very strange ways recently.</p><p>Rather than it simply being a place where people can de facto invest in Truth Social, people have been purchasing DWA shares as a way of investing in the former president himself.</p><p>\"It's a meme stock,\" says Michael Klausner, Professor of Law at Stanford University. Meme stocks are companies that have lots of small investors who are online or social media followers, who can drive the share price up and down.</p><p>Klausner says many who have invested in DWAC are Mr Trump's own supporters.</p><p>\"They think that Trump's name attached to something is going to be valuable,\" he says.</p><p>It means DWAC's share price goes up when Donald Trump's fortunes are on the rise, and down when they are taking a turn for the worse.</p><p>On Monday 7 November, it surged after reports emerged that he planned to run for president in 2024. But nine days later, when he finally confirmed the news in a speech that was criticised as \"low energy\" - the stock price fell.</p><p>The theory here is that although DWAC is merging with Truth Social, what it's really doing is giving Donald Trump an opportunity to float himself - his personal brand - on the stock exchange. If that is the case, it wouldn't matter so much if Mr Trump were to stop using Truth Social - as the social media company is only a proxy for the man himself.</p><p>For Josh Tucker from NYU, the situation raises interesting moral questions.</p><p>\"I have never personally heard of something like this before - that there is a large amount of money tracking what seems to be the political fortunes of a politician.\"</p><p>He warns that a politician might go on to make decisions based not on what is good for their political aspirations, but their financial ones instead.</p><p>\"If you're a Republican, you might want your Republican nominee to use the media to the best of their ability,\" he says.</p><p>Tucker argues that if Republicans were to elect Donald Trump as their presidential nominee, they would expect him to utilise wider social media in campaigning - rather than just limiting himself to one platform for financial gain.</p><p>But Donald Trump may have anticipated this problem. Buried in the merger agreement there is another provision that allows him to use other social media platforms for \"political messaging\".</p><p>It may be a \"loophole\", says Klausner, that would allow Trump to tweet without breaching the contract.</p><p>Not only that, but Mr Trump is only bound by the agreement to post exclusively on Truth Social until July 2023, says Ohlrogge.</p><p>\"My reading is after that point [legally] he'd be able post directly on Twitter, without posting first on Truth Social,\" he says.</p><p>There is another reason to think Donald Trump might come back onto Twitter. The merger itself is currently under Federal investigation.</p><p>The deal could still fall through, at which point Donald Trump's legal commitment to post exclusively on Truth Social would also be ripped up.</p><p>Mr Trump might lose money, but it would open the door still wider for a Twitter return.</p><p>As with many of Mr Trump's financial affairs, it's complicated. And Donald Trump is not a person who is easy to predict.</p><p>But what we do know is that were he to stick with Truth Social exclusively, and complete the Spac merger, he would likely earn a small fortune.</p><p>It's hard to see how that's not a major factor in his thinking. Will that calculation change as we get closer to an election?</p><p>It may well do. But for now, Mr Trump says he's staying put.</p><p>Follow James Clayton on Twitter</p>",

        "content": "<p>The Grand Theft Auto franchise has been a phenomenal success since it was first launched exactly 25 years ago, making billions of dollars for its American owner Take-Two Interactive.</p><p>So it may come as a surprise to learn that its creators, Dundee-based DMA Design, were far from confident about GTA's prospects as they struggled with creative and technical problems during its development in the 1990s.</p><p>Colin Macdonald, who joined DMA a few months before the launch of the action-adventure video game in 1997, explains: \"In mid-development, there was an informal staff survey on which of the seven titles they were working on would be the most successful and least successful.</p><p>\"The one voted most likely not to succeed was Grand Theft Auto.</p><p>\"That's because, mid-development, the direction of the game wasn't clear. It was also quite buggy - you couldn't play it for more than a couple of minutes without it crashing, so certainly at grassroots level there wasn't a lot of confidence in it.\"</p><p>Colin, who was to become the producer of GTA 2 and later Channel 4's first games commissioning editor, says the atmosphere at DMA was \"quite relaxed\" by the time he joined.</p><p>\"GTA went through a lot of different iterations and was quite a troubled development, and wasn't really regarded well for most of the time it was in production.</p><p>\"By the time I joined it was pretty much done and the team was actually quite happy because they had kind of got shot of it.</p><p>\"They were looking forward to sitting back, planning a sequel properly, redoing the things that they weren't happy with, and just looking forward to getting stuck into iterating on it and seeing where else they could take it.\"</p><p>Fans of GTA may also be surprised to learn that the franchise actually stemmed from a technology experiment - with a dinosaur as its central character.</p><p>Colin explains: \"One of the original founding programmers at DMA, Mike Dailly, was basically doing a tech experiment as a way of showing how buildings could look in 3D from top down with a little bit of perspective.</p><p>\"So he basically came up with a dinosaur game. You had this city that moved around in some form of 3D, but you were a dinosaur roaming around and destroying the buildings. That was what Grand Theft Auto started as.</p><p>\"He then added in little cars driving around, just to bring the city to life.</p><p>\"Someone had the bright idea to see what it would be like driving one of the cars rather than controlling the dinosaur and suddenly it changed into a car game, rather than a dinosaur game.</p><p>\"It was called Race 'n' Chase for a good while. And then someone realised, 'oh, actually we'll try letting the player get out of the car and run around and jump in and out of other cars'.</p><p>\"It was really only at that point it morphed into Grand Theft Auto.\"</p><p>Overhauling the original idea brought its own problems, according to Colin.</p><p>\"When you are changing a game so fundamentally like that, all sorts of problems get introduced.</p><p>\"You have developed code that is no longer doing what it was originally intended to do. So there's all sorts of problems - the game gets very buggy and crashes a lot, and the team are feeling like the whole process is completely changing and they are not doing what they originally set out to do.</p><p>\"But actually, this process of evolving and iterating is what made it feel so dynamic.</p><p>\"So although it was a very frustrating process for the team, it meant they could see what really worked, iterate on it and give the game a new direction.</p><p>\"They also had time to polish it, so they started doing things like adding skid marks and shadows and nice sound effects and the radio stations - all of those things that really brought the world to life.\"</p><p>Colin says that although GTA only came together in its final six months of development, there were signs that it could connect with a wide audience.</p><p>\"The team were playing it in their own lunchtimes, which is always a rare thing.</p><p>\"After you spend a couple of years developing something, you are usually sick to the back teeth of seeing it - the last thing you want to do is see it again in your spare time.\"</p><p>Colin says the sequel he produced involved making technical changes to make the game more \"structurally sound\" and moving the game from being set in the contemporary world.</p><p>\"We wanted to make it feel a little bit more futuristic. That gave us more creative licence with the vehicles, with the weapons, with the types of environments you would see.</p><p>\"In hindsight, that probably hasn't resonated with audiences as well as the contemporary vehicles and cities. Most of the Grand Theft Auto games have gone back to being set more or less in the present day.\"</p><p>Colin adds that despite the franchise's birth pangs, there was a sense within the original team that they were on to something.</p><p>\"We knew we had something special - the fact that the team were playing it in their own time is a really strong indicator of that - but there are countless games that come out every year that are creatively and technically brilliant but just don't sell particularly well, for whatever reason.</p><p>\"Most people don't hear about them - they are not quite capturing the zeitgeist of the moment - and Grand Theft Auto could easily have been another one of those.</p><p>\"It's been quite a surprise to see it still do so well a quarter of a century later.\"</p><p>* You can learn more about Rockstar Games' and GTA's history by listening to BBC 5 Live podcast Bugzy Malone's Grandest Gamehere.</p>",

The company said it was \"committed\" to making ongoing improvements to help ensure the platform is \"safe for everyone\".</p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said \"lives and families\" had been destroyed by \"those who encourage vulnerable internet users to self-harm\".</p><p>\"Our changes will ensure the full force of the law applies to those callous and reckless individuals who try to manipulate the vulnerable online in this way,\" Mr Raab said.</p><p>This measure should come as no real surprise - it was proposed by a parliamentary committee in December 2021.</p><p>And there are obvious questions about how effective it will be. Are police going to prosecute a distressed child for posting pictures of their own self-harm scars? Does this clause weigh the law disproportionately against the individual rather than the platforms?</p><p>Might this particular clause have helped Molly? It's hard to know. Coroner Andrew Walker concluded that Molly was likely affected by the dark and depressing content and that some posts \"romanticised\" acts of self-harm.</p><p>The Molly Rose Foundation - set up in her memory - today said it \"appears a significant move\".</p><p>But I spoke to Molly's father Ian last week about the progress of the Online Safety Bill. He said years of campaigning \"have led me to not believe in anyone's words but instead judge them by their actions, because it's only when a positive step is taken will I believe it\".</p><p>It would have been Molly's birthday today.

        "slug": "rolls-royce-tests-a-jet-engine-running-on-hydrogen",
        "content": "<p>In a windswept corner of a military site on Salisbury Plain a small aircraft jet engine is undergoing tests that could one day lead to huge changes within the aviation industry.</p><p>The engine itself is almost completely conventional. It is a Rolls-Royce AE-2100A gas turbine, a design used widely on regional aeroplanes around the world.</p><p>What is wholly unusual about it is the fuel being used. This is the first time a modern aircraft engine has ever been run on hydrogen.</p><p>Devoid of bodywork, with its intricate wiring and pipework exposed, it sits securely fastened to a sturdy test rig, while engineers cluster around an array of screens in the control room, a safe distance away.</p><p>The tests are being carried out by Rolls-Royce, after development work in Derby and in partnership with the airline easyJet.</p><p>The immediate aim is a simple one - to show that it is possible to run and control a jet engine using hydrogen fuel, rather than conventional aviation fuels.</p><p>In the longer term, the plan is for hydrogen power to play a major role in allowing the aviation industry to continue growing, while cutting climate change emissions dramatically.</p><p>\"The reason we're looking at hydrogen is really the drive for Net Zero,\" explains Alan Newby, director of aerospace technology at Rolls-Royce.</p><p>\"Normally we would run this thing on kerosene. Kerosene is a hydrocarbon and therefore produces carbon dioxide when it burns.</p><p>\"The beauty of looking at a fuel like hydrogen is that it doesn't contain any carbon and, therefore, when it burns it produces no CO2\".</p><p>The project is being supported by easyJet, which has contributed several million pounds towards the initial trials.</p><p>The company believes that hydrogen power offers the best route to reducing emissions from short haul aviation.</p><p>\"We started a few years ago looking at what might power the aircraft of the future,\" explains David Morgan, easyJet's chief operating officer.</p><p>\"We looked at battery technology, and it was quite clear that the battery technology was probably not going to do it for the large commercial aircraft that we fly.</p><p>\"We've come to the conclusion that hydrogen is a very exciting proposition for us.\"</p><p>The advantage of hydrogen over batteries is that it provides much more power per kilogram. Batteries are simply too heavy to power larger planes.</p><p>Yet hydrogen aviation remains a very long way off. The tests carried out so far have simply shown that a jet engine using hydrogen can be started up and run at low speed.</p><p>But to go from there to building a wholly new engine, capable of powering a passenger aircraft safely will take a great deal more research - and significant investment.</p><p>The aircraft themselves will also need to be redesigned. Hydrogen, even in liquid form, takes up about four times as much space as the kerosene required to fly the same distance.</p><p>To make it into a liquid in the first place, it needs to be cooled to -253C. Then, before being burned, it must be turned back into a gas.</p><p>\"There's a big change from the aircraft point of view,\" says Alan Newby at Rolls-Royce.</p><p>\"They're going to have to have a tank containing the hydrogen. You've got to keep it at this really, really cold temperature.</p><p>\"Then there's the issue of how you feed it through to the engine as well.\"</p><p>The other key question is where the hydrogen itself comes from, because that will have a dramatic impact on the environmental benefits it can provide</p><p>The fuel used in the tests is so-called green hydrogen produced at the European Marine Energy Centre in the Orkney Islands.</p><p>It is made by using an electric current to split water into its components, hydrogen and oxygen. The electricity required is produced using wave and wind power. This makes it a very clean fuel.</p><p>But most of the hydrogen produced for industrial use today is obtained from a process which involves mixing high temperature steam with natural gas under high pressure.</p><p>However, this produces a considerable amount of carbon dioxide, which is then released into the atmosphere. It also requires a considerable amount of energy - which is often provided by burning fossil fuels.</p><p>One alternative is what's known as blue hydrogen. This is produced in the same way, but the carbon dioxide is captured and either stored or reused.</p><p>In theory, this should make it a cleaner, low-carbon fuel.

You hear it for cars, for trucks, for ships, for planes, for home heating, for chemicals.</p><p>\"At the moment the UK effectively produces zero green hydrogen. To fulfil all the needs everyone wants is absolutely impossible.\"</p><p>Mr Finch believes this means supplies of green hydrogen will probably have to be rationed for decades to come, and he says aviation may not be a priority for governments.</p><p>All of this means it is likely to be decades before zero-emission hydrogen planes become an everyday reality.</p><p>Even then, they are likely to be confined to short haul markets, at least to begin with. On long haul routes, synthetic sustainable fuels are widely expected to offer a more practical solution.</p><p>Nevertheless, these first tests on Salisbury Plain may one day be seen as the first, tentative steps towards a technological revolution in the industry.</p>",

        "content": "<p>For those who work there and those who use it, Twitter continues to be on a rollercoaster under the leadership of Elon Musk, who bought the firm for $44bn (£36.3m) at the end of October.</p><p>The tumult has brought into sharper focus some of the platform's failings. Like all social networks, Twitter has long grappled with problems regarding privacy, hate speech and abuse.</p><p>But for some of its roughly 300 million monthly users, it has also been a place where they have built businesses, found love, launched campaigns and raised awareness for issues that are important to them.</p><p>I spoke to three women who say being on Twitter changed their lives for the better.</p><p>Catherine Cooke is a teaching assistant</p><p>I didn't start out looking for romance. But what I did use Twitter for was support, it's quite an isolating thing going through a divorce. And you can of course talk to real-life friends and family, but sometimes they're a little bit too close. Sometimes it's just very useful to have a sounding board.</p><p>You can have a vent and a rant. And there's somebody there who will either be sympathetic or maybe tell you off, but you will definitely get a reaction, and probably some quite honest feedback as well. I started off really using Twitter as a bit of a diary.</p><p>Along the way, I found lots of people who were going through the same thing or had been through the same thing, and had useful information or advice.</p><p>As far as the romance side of it goes, really that came out of friendships I'd made on Twitter. I like music and I got chatting to people about it. One of those people eventually ended up being my partner. But it did start out in friendship, a shared love of music and general chit-chat.</p><p>I love Twitter. There's so many people out there that I feel very, very strongly about even though we've never met, which does sound a bit weird. Online friends are a different sort of friend from real-life friends, but they're really important. I feel like I couldn't have got through the last couple of years without those people. I'm very positive about Twitter, I think it can be an absolute force for good.</p><p>Twitter has changed my life, I can't believe I'm actually saying that but it's true. I've gone from being on my own and going through divorce, to feeling that I've met the love of my life. I would never have met him if it hadn't been for Twitter. I feel really, really lucky.</p><p>Gail Myerscough is an illustrator and pattern designer</p><p>Twitter has been amazing. I've got 18,400 followers, so I've got a real audience for my work. But it's also been really supportive. People have been with me on my journey. I was made redundant in Covid - this was my side hustle and then it became my full-time job. I also met my husband on Twitter.</p><p>I've got brand ambassadors now on Twitter who retweet me, I've got repeat customers. I've worked with some amazing people. Tim Burgess from the band The Charlatans contacted me one day and said, \"I really like your work\". And then he asked me to design a turntable for him. So we designed a limited-edition turntable - it was brilliant.</p><p>I get a lot of traffic from Twitter. I do have Instagram, but the algorithms and engagement make it more difficult to get people to look at your work.</p><p>I'm really worried about what's happening [since Elon Musk took over] because like I say, a lot of my business and support comes from Twitter. If Twitter went, I'd have to build my business elsewhere, and I don't know where that would be to get the same engagement and orders.</p><p>Suw Charman-Anderson founded Ada Lovelace Day, an annual celebration of women working in Stem (science, tech, engineering and maths)</p><p>I started the Ada Lovelace Day Twitter account at the end of 2008. And at that point, the idea of having a day celebrating women in Stem - well it was just an idea. I didn't have any resources or any way to reach people. Twitter was the obvious solution. In all honesty, I don't think Ada Lovelace Day would have become the movement that it did without the help of Twitter.</p><p>We have 40% of our audience in the UK, and about 40% in North America. The other 20% is in about 150 countries around the world. So we have followers from across South America, Africa, Asia, it has allowed us to reach people in countries where the media isn't going to pick us up.</p><p>With a bit of care, it has been possible to curate an experience on Twitter that is generally pleasant. Obviously, there is always the opportunity for things to go wrong. I have experienced the Twitter pile-on - not quite becoming the main character thankfully, but adjacent to it - and that is never pleasant.</p><p>But overall, I think it has been a positive experience for me and I am grateful to Twitter for allowing Ada Lovelace Day to flourish in the way that it has. I see other organisations for women in Stem and all sorts of other things that exist because Twitter connects them with their community and their audience in a way that other tools just don't.</p><p>I just don't see the same level of engagement on Facebook or LinkedIn for example. I think Twitter is interesting, it's unique in its properties, and I would be really heartbroken if it did break permanently or if we saw a huge drop off in numbers.</p><p>Hear Catherine, Gail and Suw on this week's Tech Tent podcast</p><p>You can follow Zoe Kleinman on Twitter (@zsk), and on Mastodon (@zsk@mastodonapp.uk).</p>",

That was the message from Kenya's foreign affairs ministry when it warned job seekers who were attracted by the promise of greener pastures in south-east Asia.</p><p>It follows the rescue of more than 60 Kenyans from Myanmar and Laos over the last few months - after the sales and customer service jobs they applied for in Thailand turned out to be a cover for cyber-crime, prostitution and even organ theft.</p><p>\"Already one young Kenyan has died as a result of a botched operation by quack doctors operating in the Chinese-run factories in Myanmar,\" the ministry said last week.</p><p>I spoke to two women about their recent experiences. Requesting anonymity, a 31-year-old, who has a a diploma in hotel management, and a 35-year-old high school graduate told me how they had left for jobs in Thailand in August with a promise of a monthly salary of $800 (£675).</p><p>A month before their departure they each had borrowed nearly $2,000 to pay their agents for the trip and underwent a short training session.</p><p>Yet upon arrival in Thailand their handlers took them on a long journey by road, eventually crossing a river into neighbouring Laos.</p><p>They ended up in a 15-storey building, which became their full-time residence - although they did not know in which town or city they were located.</p><p>It was here they learnt that instead of customer service roles, they were there to engage in cyber-crime activities - namely to target Americans by creating enticing profiles on Tinder, Instagram and Facebook.</p><p>\"They fall in love with you and you can tell them about crypto-currency. You start stealing from them,\" the 31-year-old woman said, describing in Swahili how they were both forced to work in a vast call centre-like hall with hundreds of others made up of a variety of nationalities.</p><p>Neither of them received their promised salary and instead were threatened with sex work or organ harvesting if they failed to lure enough victims online.</p><p>\"As a woman you may be forced into sex trafficking.

And yet Apple holds all the cards when it comes to Twitter.</p><p>Firstly, as others have found out, only Apple decides who's allowed on the App Store. If Apple wanted to, it could stop Twitter from being downloaded on iPhones around the world - which would be a devastating blow for Twitter.</p><p>Not only that but Apple can also charge what it likes for the privilege of being on the App Store. For companies like Twitter, it can charge anywhere from 15-30% for in-app purchases.</p><p>That charge has been challenged in the US courts by Fortnite producer Epic Games.

This is a very complicated Bill and there's lots of aspects to it, but I wouldn't want any of your listeners to think for a minute that we are removing anything when it comes to children because we're not.\"</p><p>The bill previously included a section which required \"the largest, highest-risk platforms\" to tackle some legal but harmful material accessed by adults.</p><p>It meant that the likes of Facebook, Instagram and YouTube would have been told to prevent people being exposed to content relating to self-harm and eating disorders as well as misogynistic posts.</p><p>That prompted criticism that the bill opened the door for technology companies to censor legal speech.</p><p>It was \"legislating for hurt feelings\", former Conservative leadership candidate Kemi Badenoch said.</p><p>That requirement has now been removed from the bill - tech giants will instead have to introduce a system allowing adult users more control to filter out harmful content they do not want to see.</p><p>Ms Donelan insisted the legislation was not being watered down - and that tech companies had the expertise to protect people online.</p><p>\"These are massive, massive corporations that have the money, the knowhow and the tech to be able to adhere to this,\" she said.</p><p>She warned that those who did not comply would face significant fines and \"huge reputational damage\".</p><p>Adults will be able to access and post anything legal, provided a platform's terms of service allow it - although, children must still be protected from viewing harmful material.</p><p>In July, the former minister David Davis was one of nine senior Conservatives who wrote a letter to then Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries, warning the legal but harmful provision posed a threat to free speech.</p><p>He told the BBC he was glad it had now been taken out the bill but he still had other \"serious worries\" about the threat to privacy and freedom of expression which could \"undermine end-to-end encryption\".</p><p>In some scenarios the bill permits the government to direct companies to use technology to examine private messages.</p><p>\"I urge the government to accept the amendments in my name to fix these technology notices so that they no longer pose a threat to encryption, which we all rely on to keep safe online,\" he said.</p><p>Lucy Powell MP, Labour's shadow culture secretary, criticised the decision to remove obligations over \"legal but harmful\" material.</p><p>She said it gave a \"free pass to abusers and takes the public for a ride\" that it was \"a major weakening, not strengthening, of the bill\".</p><p>And the boss of charity the Samaritans, Julie Bentley, said \"the damaging impact that this type of content has doesn't end on your 18th birthday\".</p><p>\"Increasing the controls that people have is no replacement for holding sites to account through the law and this feels very much like the Government snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.\"</p><p>But Ms Donelan told BBC News the revised bill offered \"a triple shield of protection - so it's certainly not weaker in any sense\".</p><p>This requires platforms to:</p><p>This could include content promoting eating disorders or inciting hate on the basis of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender reassignment- although, there will be exemptions to allow legitimate debate.</p><p>But the first two parts of the triple shield were already included in the draft bill.</p><p>At its heart this complicated bill has a simple aim: those things that are criminal or unacceptable in real life should be treated the same online.</p><p>But that means reining in the power of the big tech companies and bringing an end to the era of self-regulation.</p><p>Getting the bill this far has been a complex balancing act. Dropping the need to define what counts as \"legal but harmful\" content may have satisfied free speech advocates.</p><p>Including new criminal offences around encouraging self-harm or sharing deep fake porn could feel like a win for campaigners.</p><p>But it won't satisfy everyone - the Samaritans for example don't feel it adequately protects adults from harmful material.</p><p>The Molly Rose Foundation set up by Molly Russell's family believes the bill's been watered down. It's not about freedom of speech, it said in a statement, it's about the freedom to live.</p><p>And there's much about the bill that is still unclear.</p><p>Internet safety campaigner Mr Russell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I think the most harmful content to [Molly] was content that could be described as legal but harmful.\"</p><p>He added: \"It is very hard to understand that something that was important as recently as July, when the bill would have had a full reading in the Commons and was included in the bill, this legal but harmful content, it is very hard to understand why that suddenly can't be there.\"</p><p>Campaign group the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) said platforms might feel \"off the hook\" because of the new focus on user controls \"in place of active duties to deal with bad actors and dangerous content\".</p><p>Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter indicated tough rules were needed, it said. Twitter recently reinstated a number of banned accounts, including that of Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, which had been suspended over anti-Semitic posts.</p><p>But CCDH chief executive Imran Ahmed added it was welcome the government \"had strengthened the law against encouragement of self-harm and distribution of intimate images without consent\".</p><p>It was recently announced that the encouragement of self-harm would be prohibited in the update to the Online Safety Bill.</p><p>Other changes will require technology companies to assess and publish the risk of potential harm to children on their sites.</p><p>Companies must also explain how they will enforce age limits - knowing users' ages will be a key part in preventing children seeing certain types of content.</p><p>And users' accounts must not be removed unless they have broken the law or the site's rules.</p><p>Tech policy expert at the Open Rights Group, Dr Monica Horten, said the bill lacked definition about how companies will know the age of their users.</p><p>\"Companies are likely to use AI systems analysing biometric data including head and hand measurements, and voices,\" she said.</p><p>\"This is a recipe for a gated internet, currently subject to minimal regulation and run by third-party private operators.\"</p><p>Much of the enforcement of the new law will be by communications and media regulator Ofcom, which will be able to fine companies up to 10% of their worldwide revenue.</p><p>It must now consult the victims' commissioner, the domestic-abuse commissioner and the children's commissioner when drawing up the codes technology companies must follow.</p><p>Additional reporting by Rachel Russell.</p><p>Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

A white male US-resident does not represent the world.\"</p><p>Already a prolific tweeter, Mr Musk has been posting 84% more often since buying the platform, according to Social Blade.</p><p>On Tuesday, 22 November, he fired off 75 separate tweets, either as posts, replies or retweets. This is a record for him.</p><p>\"It's great to have a CEO who uses the product,\" a former senior product manager at Twitter, who wishes to remain anonymous, says.</p><p>And it should not impede Mr Musk's direction of the company.</p><p>But he says: \"I think people who tweet a lot are addicted - and possibly narcissistic. No single person has enough interesting things to say to the entire world to tweet more than five times a day.\"</p><p>On average Mr Musk is now tweeting once every 15 minutes during normal waking hours.</p><p>The experts we spoke to all agreed that having a CEO immersed in his or her platform can be a good thing but all agreed that the type of content Mr Musk is posting could be problematic.</p><p>Recent tweets have included sexual imagery and swearing. And, responding to critics saying he was killing Twitter, he posted an adaptation of a meme of a man smiling and swearing at a graveside during a funeral.</p><p>Mr Navarra says Mr Musk is a huge engagement driver for Twitter and his recent tweets have brought in a significant number of new users or reactivated old ones.</p><p>\"We only have to look back to another character that shares an alarming amount of similarities... with Elon Musk, which is Donald Trump,\" he says.</p><p>\"Trump was also a huge driver of activity and engagement from his tweets and I'm sure that was a benefit to Twitter.</p><p>\"But I would also say he's probably a net negative in terms of the problems it brought with it for content moderation and toxic content.</p><p>\"Elon Musk is having a similar effect on the platform.\"</p><p>Twitter permanently suspended President Trump after the storming of the US Capitol building, in Washington, in January 2021, citing \"the risk of further incitement of violence\".</p><p>Mr Musk reinstated his account on 19 November, following a poll of Twitter users, though Mr Trump has not subsequently tweeted.</p><p>While gaining 8.6 million followers since buying Twitter, Mr Musk himself has followed only six new people in that time - bringing the total he follows to 129.</p><p>Twitter founder Jack Dorsey followed about 3,500 people when he was chief executive. Former president Barack Obama follows 570,000.</p><p>And commentators say following so few limits Mr Musk's view of what people are talking about on the social network</p><p>\"He has no idea what the experience of normal users is,\" the former Twitter manager says.</p><p>\"For example, he never sees ads - because we limit advertising served to the top 1,000 or so users. So he wouldn't have understood that part of the product before he bought it.\"</p><p>Mr Musk reportedly told Twitter's marketing team adverts should \"look like tweets\", when the company's ads already were tweets.</p><p>The former Twitter manager also says Mr Musk's skewed experience on the site as a top influencer may prevent him understanding how to improve it and grow it.</p><p>Twitter is smaller than other social networks and \"average time spent was a severe constraint to our growth and ads business\".</p><p>\"People who are committed users spend a lot of time on the site - but they need to find a way to increase the time that the masses spend,\" the former Twitter insider says.</p><p>Every time Mr Musk logs into his account, he is greeted with notifications making him feel good and want to stay on the site.</p><p>But for most users, this is not the case.</p><p>Growing the number of Twitter users to a billion is one of Mr Musk's key goals.</p><p>Now, there are about 300 million - which, at the current rate, is the number of followers Mr Musk himself will have in two years' time, according to Social Blade projections.</p>",

They simply lie about their date of birth to get round age restrictions on websites.</p><p>As part of the bill, all sites that publish pornography will have to put in enhanced checks to ensure their users really are 18 or over.</p><p>This could include adults using secure age verification technology to prove that they possess a credit card and are over 18, or having a third-party service confirm their age against government data.</p><p>Sites that fail to act could be fined up to 10% of their global turnover by regulator Ofcom, and bosses of these websites could also be held criminally liable if they fail to co-operate.</p><p>Children's safety groups have long been calling for age verification on porn sites, over fears it is too easy for minors to access publicly available material online.</p><p>There were proposals to use what's known as porn blockers - which would have forced commercial porn providers to verify users' ages or face a UK ban - but they were dropped in 2019.</p><p>Will Gardner, CEO of Childnet International, told the BBC: \"In the offline world we have robust systems to prevent children from accessing things which may harm them.</p><p>\"People have to show ID before purchasing pornography, alcohol and cigarettes, or before watching an 18 film at the cinema. We want to carry these same protections into the online environment.\"</p><p>There are widespread concerns that exposure to porn is affecting the way young people understand healthy relationships, sex and consent.</p><p>Experts who work with children say it puts them at risk from predators and could possibly stop them reporting abuse.</p><p>According to online safety group Internet Matters, more than half of mothers fear it gives their children a poor portrayal of women.</p><p>It will be up to companies to decide how best to comply with the new rules, but Ofcom may recommend the use of certain age verification technologies.</p><p>Already the UK's largest site with adult content, OnlyFans, has adopted age verification for all new UK subscribers, using third-party tools provided by Yoti and Ondato.</p><p>Despite the widespread use of age verification technology in sectors such as online gambling, there are still fears it poses privacy risks. Campaigners have warned that a database of pornography users would be a huge hacking target for blackmailers.</p><p>Monica Horten, of the Open Rights Group, which campaigns to preserve digital rights and freedoms, said the bill created a \"Hobson's choice\" about content for children.</p><p>She said platforms would have to \"either lock them out entirely, or sanitise their platform to the level of the youngest child likely to access their service\".</p><p>Ms Horten added the only alternative would be to \"guess the age\" of users with AI systems using biometric data which she said \"raised serious privacy concerns\".</p><p>But Iain Corby, executive director of the Age Verification Providers Association, said firms he represented had developed a wide range of methods to prove someone's age online without disclosing their identity to the websites they visit.</p><p>\"Just as someone on the door of a nightclub might guess your age by how old you look, for those who are well over a legal age artificial intelligence software can estimate your age based on a selfie or even a voice recording, and has been tested to prove it is generally far more accurate than the average bouncer.</p><p>\"Where there is a stricter legal limit, more traditional forms of age verification may be needed, such as the use of a passport or driving licence.</p><p>\"The essence of these methods is they allow you prove your age without giving away your identity, so you can remain anonymous online if you wish.\"</p>",

        "content": "<p>Recent mass layoffs at big US tech firms have plunged into uncertainty several Indians working on non-immigrant visas such as the H1-B. Surbhi Gupta, a product manager at Meta who was among those affected, spoke to California-based journalist Savita Patel about how it took her time to accept it, the uncertainties that H1-B visa holders deal with, and what she plans to do next.</p><p>It was my mum's birthday. I was staying up late to wish her and that's when I started getting messages from my friends about layoff announcements. They were all anxious.</p><p>At around 6am here, I received an email that I'd been let go. I had joined Meta earlier this year as a product manager. My team was shocked because I'd been performing really well.</p><p>It went against my motto, work is worship, instilled early by my favourite teacher at school. Initially, it felt like the Titanic sinking because I was losing access to things one by one - workplace, then email, then laptop. But I was pleasantly overwhelmed and surprised in a positive way by my network on LinkedIn. Many colleagues, ex-colleagues and friends reached out in a very supportive way, making introductions and referrals. It made me feel like I have so many people in this country who care for me, made me feel like I belong to this country.</p><p>My last day at Meta is in January and my H1-B visa [a non-immigrant visa that allows firms in the US to hire foreigners for up to six years] allows me to stay in the US for another 60 days, so early March is the deadline for me to find another job.</p><p>The job search is going to be difficult now as hiring will be slow in December because of the holidays. But I'm very focused. I am in touch with multiple companies and exploring options.</p><p>What I'll miss most about Meta is the workplace and my colleagues. Being at Meta meant not only being able to build an amazing product for millions of people, but also being able to participate in fireside chats and growth and learning opportunities. As a product manager, it would have been rewarding to see the project I was working on go further.</p><p>My parents taught me to never give up in life. They tell me to stay strong because I'm a person who can convert problems into opportunities. They tell me 'aur kuch accha mil jayega' [you'll find something better].</p><p>But my ability to work and stay in the US depends on my H1-B visa. I moved to the US in 2009 and I have worked very hard to build my career on my own strength and intellect. I have worked in prominent companies like Tesla, Intuit, etc., built great products, got top ratings, paid taxes, and contributed to the US economy for more than 15 years, but I feel that I am in the same place as far as permanent residency goes because of the limitations of the H1-B. I was crowned Miss Bharat California [a beauty pageant] by my idol, Bollywood actress Sushmita Sen. I have walked the ramp at New York Fashion Week. I have my own podcast.</p><p>We face unnecessary stress because the US has a country cap which takes forever for Indian H1-B holders to get a green card (permanent residency). Even though I am in the green card queue, when I track my status, I sometimes get a wait-time of two decades, and at other times, 60 years.</p><p>Our personal life suffers because of the uncertainty. Buying a home has been a question mark in my mind - do I invest in a home and then what if I have to leave. In spite of having gone ahead with the YC [Y Combinator is an American technology start-up accelerator], I can't start a company even though I have a great idea because I don't have a green card.</p><p>I travelled to 30 countries before turning 30 years old, but now I'm unable to travel much, even though it's my dream to travel the world, because I'm nervous about facing problems while trying to get my H1-B visa re-stamped. I have heard from my friends who work at great companies like Google and PayPal about getting stuck abroad.</p><p>I have even curtailed my travels home to India. A few years back, I got stuck in India. I had gone to attend a wedding and I had to get my H1-B visa stamped. But that took several months as it went into random administrative processing and I wasn't even sure when it would come through. The uncertainty and the wait caused problems in my marriage. The visa issues had a very big role in my marriage. It was not the only reason, but it became one of the major reasons for the break-up of my marriage. I also had to drop out of a semester at New York University, where I was studying at the time, because I didn't know when I would be able to return to the US. Why do people on H1-Bs have to deal with this?</p><p>I have not met my parents since the Covid-19 pandemic because they haven't been able to come to visit me for three-and-a-half years. They are elderly, and don't keep too well. I constantly think - if my parents need support, will I be able to go to help them? Nobody realises how it impacts our life.</p><p>But despite whatever has happened, I believe this experience too has a silver lining. Spirituality is a significant part of my life. I am a believer and follower of Sadhguru ji [as followers refer to Indian yoga guru Jaggi Vasudev]. He says that we should not be identified only by or limit our identity to our professional role. In Silicon Valley, the most frequently asked question is - Which company do you work for? But I am still me, not just a product manager. Everyone should realise that they are more than just the company they work for.</p><p>As told to Savita Patel</p>",

Eventually, I shared some online - and then, other frustrated 5G users contacted me.</p><p>We had various handsets and network providers but were all experiencing similar problems.</p><p>Patrick, from Bristol, told me he could not refresh social-media apps, load maps or check Amazon order statuses while using 5G.</p><p>\"It's really frustrating,\" he said.</p><p>\"5G was promised to be incredibly fast across the country. And if anything, it's worse than what we had already. It's not acceptable.\"</p><p>Jon, from Yorkshire, said he could not access any data via 5G during his train commute to Leeds, which affected his job.</p><p>\"It makes my phone pretty worthless,\" he said.</p><p>A woman from Manchester said any 5G coverage appearing was \"still a surprise\".</p><p>There were many others.</p><p>And in Glasgow city centre, some colleagues and I found the 5G speed half that of the 4G, according to a basic speed checker.</p><p>So what is going on?</p><p>The industry insists, still only three years in to a 10-year rollout plan, everything is fine.</p><p>5G has received lots of investment from the mobile operators and government and is hailed as a faster, more reliable connection.</p><p>But it has faced several setbacks.</p><p>5G requires a lot of masts because it delivers faster speeds over shorter distances.</p><p>With a higher frequency than 4G, some say it is harmful - although, tests have found the opposite. And it has been falsely linked to the spread of Covid-19.</p><p>Gareth Elliott, of the industry trade association Mobile UK, said local objections and the need to obtain planning permission were obstacles to expanding national coverage.</p><p>\"We are working with communities, working with local authorities and we do aim to extend 5G coverage as quickly as possible,\" he said.</p><p>\"The closer you live or work to a mast, the better signal you have.\"</p><p>In 2020, UK mobile networks were ordered to strip out kit made by Chinese technology company Huawei from all 5G infrastructure, after it was deemed a national security risk.</p><p>The deadlines for completing this were recently extended.</p><p>The UK's major networks, EE, O2, Three and Vodafone, told me they were on track to meet them, happy with the progress of their rollouts, their customers generally satisfied with the service - and people tended not to notice when networks were working efficiently.</p><p>But analyst Ian Fogg, from the company OpenSignal, said the 5G experience had been oversold by over-enthusiastic marketeers.</p><p>Coverage was generally better in cities and operators varied, he said - but, overall, it was still an improvement on 4G.</p><p>\"Companies talking up 5G are often thinking not just about what's here now but what we'll be having in 18 months, two or three years time. So there's that expectation of, 'This is what it's going to do.' We're seeing some of that improvement now - but not all of it,\" Mr Fogg said.</p><p>CCS Insight chief analyst Ben Wood agrees.</p><p>\"The networks need to be very careful that there is not a huge gap between the rhetoric and the reality of the experience,\" he said.</p><p>The Department for Digital Culture, Media and Sport, which oversees mobile networks, and Ofcom, the regulator, declined to be interviewed - but Ofcom did tell me only about 10% of people in the UK currently owned 5G-enabled phones.</p><p>Most new devices do now work on 5G - but people are holding on to older handsets for longer. 5G contracts do not cost extra - but it does burn through data a lot more quickly for those not on unlimited plans.</p><p>And there is another issue.</p><p>\"We are using something called non-standalone 5G, which is the very first version of 5G,\" Mr Wood said.</p><p>\"It only delivers the 5G signal from the handset to the tower. Everything behind that is still 4G.</p><p>\"The goal is to get to a fully integrated end-to-end 5G network - but in the UK, no networks have deployed that yet.\"</p><p>And this could have a significant impact on the experience.</p><p>The aim is for 5G to be the infrastructure that will one day underpin driverless cars communicating with each other and street furniture such as signs and traffic lights.</p><p>It can reliably connect hospitals with ambulances, to share patient data and treatment advice as they travel.</p><p>And it enables better virtual- and mixed-reality environments for teaching, training and socialising.</p><p>At the 5G and 6G Innovation Centre, at Surrey University, I tried out a demo using a basic robot.</p><p>With 5G connectivity, the robot responded immediately to my commands, via an Xbox controller, for it to move.</p><p>But when we switched down to 4G, the momentary delay between me touching the controller and the robot receiving the instruction - this is called latency - resulted in drama. It faltered, and then fell rather heavily, taking me down with it.</p><p>The difference between the two was, quite literally, striking. But it would be - there was a 5G mast directly outside the window.</p><p>You can follow Zoe Kleinman on Twitter (@zsk).</p>",

Without giving a terrible spoiler, it does also in the end offer hope.</p><p>It's all the more powerful because Winslet's on-screen child is played by her own daughter - Mia Threapleton.</p><p>But the Oscar winner hopes the film will prompt a wider conversation about how vulnerable children are.</p><p>She suggests some online platforms should be banned for kids and accuses the government and tech firms of \"shirking responsibility\". You can read the full story here.</p><p>\"Whoever those people are, they know who they are, they should just step up and do better,\" she told me.</p><p>The UK was going to be the first country in the world to try and solve this problem but there have been so many delays the EU got there first.</p><p>The government has again cranked up its plan to regulate what happens online and the Online Safety Bill will be back in the Commons on Monday.</p><p>It is a massive piece of law and ministers are worried they might run out of time to get it done.</p><p>That said - its coming into force will be a genuine landmark moment.</p><p>For years, governments around the world more or less assumed that the exciting tech companies they used to like having photo opportunities with could basically regulate themselves.</p><p>That climate soured some time ago. As one senior tech executive described it: \"After tech euphoria now the pendulum has swung completely the other way.\"</p><p>And governments, at least in the UK, have concluded platforms that hold so much power cannot be left to supervise themselves.</p><p>The communications watchdog Ofcom - which currently looks after TV, radio and phones - will be given the job of setting standards for tech platforms and checking they follow them.</p><p>Crucially they'll have the power to impose hefty fines on the companies if they fall short. Alongside that there'll be new criminal offences for things like encouraging self harm.</p><p>These are big changes but some of the government's plans to confront the darkest corners of the internet have disappeared.</p><p>And to understand what's gone on, we need for a moment to look at what exactly has changed.</p><p>Neither ministers nor Ofcom were ever going to instruct Facebook, Instagram, TikTok or any other platform to take down specific content if it didn't break the law.</p><p>What they were going to do was define the kind of material that could have caused harm to people.</p><p>Companies would then have taken those definitions of racism or misogyny, for example, into account in their own terms and conditions.</p><p>The regulator could then hold them to account for if they didn't follow their own rules.</p><p>Now that's changed. The government is not going to define what is \"legal but harmful\" - leaving it up to companies to decide whether to specify those harms in their terms and conditions, if at all.</p><p>And if they don't, well, the regulator doesn't have a rule to enforce.</p><p>Ministers deny the plan has been watered down but it's hard not to conclude that the tech companies are more able to set the terms as a result of this change.</p><p>There'll be a filter for users to get rid of content they don't like - but that puts the responsibility onto the individual rather than the platform.</p><p>You may recoil at the idea of the government defining what's right and wrong - or be frustrated that it hasn't gone far enough to tame the tech giants.</p><p>What you may well end up though is confused, because this system means different platforms will make different decisions.</p><p>And as long as content is not illegal, one former Facebook executive says that for example \"if one platform wants to get rid of Tommy Robinson it can, if another platform wants to keep them all on because they are not illegal, they can keep them all on\".</p><p>But the political truth is that ministers ran into concerns on the Conservative Party's right.</p><p>Even with the \"legal but harmful\" part of the bill scrapped for everyone but under-18s, the legislation overall is still seen by some as a \"censors' charter\".</p><p>And while the idea of giving tech firms the right to scan encrypted messages to track down illegal activity may seem noble, there are genuine fears an important protection of privacy could be fundamentally undermined.</p><p>For many people, what happens online is still bewildering. For many parents - Hollywood megastars or not - what happens on teenagers' phones is desperately worrying and these changes can't remove that fear.</p><p>The proposed laws won't mean that all harmful material will disappear. And as the former Facebook executive told me: \"The big discussion we need to have is at what age should kids go online.\"</p><p>The government has tried to provide at least some solutions to these profound problems.</p><p>But as technology advances, the dilemmas may only become more complex over the coming years for parents, the public and the politicians.</p><p>I am Ruth can be seen on Thursday 8 December at 21:00 GMT on Channel 4</p>",

TikTok is owned by China-based firm ByteDance.</p><p>Nuzhin had been serving a jail term for murder but described how he had been recruited by Wagner and was then captured by the Ukrainian military. He told Ukrainian journalists he had switched sides voluntarily and denounced the mercenary group.</p><p>It is thought he was then part of a prisoner exchange and within days a gruesome video involving a sledgehammer was posted on a Wagner-linked channel on the Telegram messaging app.</p><p>NewsGuard found that TikTok's algorithm appeared to push users towards violent Wagner Group content.</p><p>When an analyst searched for the term \"Wagner\", TikTok's search bar suggested searches for \"Wagner execution\" and \"Wagner sledgehammer\". The same search in Russian resulted in the suggestions \"Wagner PMC\", \"Wagner sledgehammer\" and \"Wagner orchestra\". Wagner refers to its fighters as \"musicians\".</p><p>NewsGuard also found that videos could be found on TikTok showing another Wagner murder involving an army deserter in Syria in 2017 and that they had reached millions of users.</p><p>The online analysis group said it had also identified other music videos on the platform that advocated violence against Ukrainians, including calls to kill Ukrainians claiming they were \"Nazis\".</p><p>Responding to the report, a TikTok spokesperson said there was \"no place for hateful or violent content on our platform\". Many of the videos identified by NewsGuard were no longer available on the platform by Thursday.</p><p>\"Our Community Guidelines clearly outline that we do not allow people to use our platform to threaten or incite violence, or share attacks or slurs based on people's nationality or other protected characteristics. We will take action on content found to violate these policies,\" TikTok said.</p><p>Wagner started out as a shadowy Russian mercenary group and in 2014 went to eastern Ukraine to help Russian proxy forces oust the Ukrainian military.</p><p>It has also been active in Syria and several African countries, and has repeatedly been accused of war crimes and human rights abuses. Last week the European Parliament called for it to be added to the EU's list of terrorist organisations.</p><p>For years Yevgeny Prigozhin denied he had anything to do with Wagner, until September when he finally admitted founding the group.</p><p>Once know as \"Putin's chef\" because of his catering fortune, he appeared in recent videos recruiting inmates in Russian prisons for the war in Ukraine.</p><p>Yevgeny Nuzhin's family knew nothing of his recruitment for the war, although before he died he told Ukrainian journalists he and the other prison recruits were merely \"cannon fodder\".</p>",

Other fraud victims have also had difficulty getting refunds from Revolut.</p><p>Unlike banks, Revolut is not signed up to a code that aims to reimburse customers for this type of fraud.</p><p>The firm said it looked at cases on an individual basis, and that it was sorry customers had been defrauded.</p><p>Deborah, a dog groomer in North Yorkshire, had given her Virgin Money bank details to a fraudulent website that she thought was legitimate while online shopping.</p><p>A few weeks later, the 55-year-old got a phone call from a man claiming to be from the Virgin Money fraud department.</p><p>The fraudster said her bank account was under attack, and persuaded her to download some software that allowed him to take control of her computer.</p><p>The fraudster, who kept reassuring her that she was safe, asked her about her other accounts, and got her to transfer money out of her 12 Revolut \"vaults\".</p><p>This included savings that had taken years to build up for her grandson, and for a holiday in the US.</p><p>She lost more than £8,000 from Revolut alone, along with funds from her Virgin Money account.</p><p>While this was happening, she got warnings from Revolut, but the fraudster did not give her time to read them. He knew they were coming, and told her he was sending them.</p><p>\"I was allowing everything to go through, just thinking it was safe,\" she said.</p><p>\"I'm devastated. I'm wiped out,\" she told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme. \"It's taken away my comfort blanket.</p><p>\"It's made me angry because I've got to start again from scratch.\"</p><p>She questioned why Revolut had not stopped transactions that had not followed her normal behaviour patterns, as banks do.</p><p>Virgin Money is still investigating what happened.</p><p>Deborah was a victim of what is known as an \"authorised push payment fraud\". This is when fraudsters persuade their victims to send money themselves.</p><p>About 10 High Street banks are signed up to a code - the Contingent Reimbursement Model Code - which aims to give money back to people who fall victim to this kind of scam.</p><p>But Revolut is not a UK bank, and is not signed up to this code.</p><p>It is an e-money company that offers digital banking services.</p><p>It does not have a UK banking licence. It applied for one in January 2021 but is still waiting for the outcome.</p><p>Another person who was scammed was Mark, who runs an art and graphics company in Brighton.</p><p>He too was called by fraudsters, who persuaded him to download desktop-sharing software that let them take control of his computer.</p><p>Mark went along with it, but then became suspicious. When he checked his Revolut app 10 minutes later, he realised nearly £56,000 had been stolen.</p><p>\"My heart nearly stopped,\" he said.</p><p>He tried to get Revolut to stop the transaction, and thought the firm might protect him, but it didn't.</p><p>\"I realised I am completely alone in this,\" he said.</p><p>Although Revolut has since said it will refund £30,000, he described the situation as \"absolutely shocking\".</p><p>\"I can't trust them [Revolut]. I just feel ignored,\" he said.</p><p>The fraudsters persuaded both Deborah and Mark to download Anydesk software, which is legitimate.</p><p>Anydesk said people using its software for fraud were \"immoral and unacceptable\", and it urged users to \"never share information with anyone they do not know or trust\".</p><p>George, a project manager from Northampton, fell victim to a different kind of fraud.</p><p>In October he went on his stag night with friends in London.</p><p>He blacked out - police think his drink was probably spiked - and his phone and cards were stolen. The criminals then went on a spending spree.</p><p>They withdrew £3,000 from a bank machine, and in under four hours spent £17,500 in different shops on Regent Street.</p><p>When he contacted Revolut, he was refused a refund.</p><p>He said Revolut's view was that he either gave his PIN away or had done it himself, adding that the whole experience had left him \"feeling very vulnerable\".</p><p>Aaron Elliott-Gross, head of fraud and financial crime at Revolut, said the firm was \"very sorry to hear that our customers were targeted by fraudsters and criminals\".</p><p>Each reimbursement case is treated individually, he said, with Revolut looking at how effective its warnings were, along with the customer's behaviour, when making a decision.</p><p>Mark had been partially refunded because Revolut accepts that it \"could have done more to warn Mark\".</p><p>But Deborah was warned about her transactions, and there was no evidence criminals had accessed George's PIN, he said.</p><p>He added that in George's case, consumers using electronic wallets such as Apple Pay or Google Pay need to be aware that \"your phone passcode can be compromised, it can be overseen\". A phone can be used to make payments if the passcode is entered.</p><p>Deborah, Mark and George all said they could not contact Revolut by phone and could only speak to operatives over live chat.</p><p>Mr Elliott-Gross said the Revolut chat function was the most secure way customers could interact with the firm.</p><p>\"Having a call centre isn't a silver bullet,\" he said.</p><p>For more on this story, listen to You and Yours on BBC Sounds.</p>",

        "content": "<p>You're walking down a dark corridor of an abandoned spaceship, there's a low growl humming in your ears. Out of nowhere, glass shatters to your left and a hideous monster is upon you - its hands clawing at your face.</p><p>Welcome to The Callisto Protocol, the latest title to attempt what many have tried to do since the early days of video gaming - scare and shock players.</p><p>New technology has allowed its creators to make one of the most gruesome gaming experiences ever seen, and they are unapologetic about it.</p><p>The game has been effectively banned in Japan because the team behind it were unwilling to alter its content in order to pass local rating regulations, which would have required scenes to be modified and toned down.</p><p>Speaking to the BBC, the game's chief creative officer Chris Stone says it is \"absolutely valid\" to have visceral scenes on screen, \"without a doubt\".</p><p>Whereas some horror experiences rely on a player's imagination to do most of the work, Stone and his team have also opted to harness the graphical power of the latest consoles to show, in intricate detail, what happens to the game's characters when they meet their untimely and bloody end. He argues that people who play horror games \"inherently like the adrenaline\".</p><p>\"It's the same reason people skydive or bungee jump,\" he continues. \"On the morbid side, I think it's the same reason people drive slowly past car accidents. They like to see things at a distance, it's the taboo of it, that people want to be a part of.\"</p><p>For Louise Blaine, horror expert and presenter of BBC Radio 3's Sound of Gaming, \"there's a real delight in being shocked by gore\" if it's \"justified\" within the story that's being told.</p><p>The Callisto Protocol is the latest in a long line of titles, like Resident Evil and Silent Hill, that have used fear and plenty of blood to entertain audiences.</p><p>\"Gaming is now able to tell smarter and smarter stories, they can splatter us with as much blood and guts as they like to get the job done,\" Blaine explains.</p><p>\"Feeling a moment of horror, and then laughing at the feeling it gave you, is a vital part of the horror experience. We need to go through something, otherwise what's the point?\"</p><p>Like film and television before it, gaming has occasionally upset some who feel that it's unnecessary to display graphic content on screen.</p><p>Gaming has largely moved-on from those conversations, just as its film and television counterparts have. But titles like this are an opportunity for some to raise eyebrows again and question their validity.</p><p>Blaine thinks it's frustrating the horror genre can be treated in this way. \"This debate raises its ugly head every time someone dares to do something a little different or pushes something in a new direction,\" she suggests.</p><p>\"As long as The Callisto Protocol can justify its gore, whether that's for comedy horror, I-can't-believe-it-did-that outrage, or something darker, I think drenching us in monstrous alien blood can only be a good thing.</p><p>\"And the truth is, if you don't like horror games, no-one is making you play. As long as it's labelled for the right audiences, they should be able to watch and experience whatever they want.\"</p><p>The Callisto Protocol is an 18 rated game in Europe.</p><p>There's a fundamental difference between horror games and their film or television brethren.</p><p>In games, the player is in control of the story and has responsibility for creating the outcome. The player isn't passive, they actively choose to open a suspicious looking door or to walk down a creepy corridor, making the experience arguably more personal and the scares more intense.</p><p>Stone says their overt use of guts and gore is designed to reward people for the deaths in their game. \"The player's imagination is always going to build tension, and there's plenty of that in our game, but these death scenes validate that imagination,\" he says.</p><p>Dying is integral to the mechanics of many video games, whether it's being shot in Call of Duty or Mario failing to jump onto a platform. Death in gaming is often an event to learn from and avoiding it in the game a challenge to overcome.</p><p>Stone argues, even though it may be \"morbid\" to say, the game's most gruesome moments are \"almost a reward for dying in the game and losing progress\".</p><p>\"There are plenty of games where you die over and over again in the same way, you get so tired of it that you put the controller down.</p><p>\"That's not what we want,\" he adds, \"we want the player to find it painfully rewarding - so they want to do it again and see what happens next so we go through a lot of effort in terms of crafting all these horror moments.\"</p><p>Actress Karen Fukuhara plays Dani Nakamura, a central character who's busy leading a resistance group at Black Iron Prison. She's used to performing in projects with plenty of blood and guts on display, as one of the main characters in Amazon Prime show The Boys. She thinks horror experiences are popular because \"people love to lose control\" especially if \"they're in a comfortable environment\".</p><p>\"There's a spontaneity that comes with horror, because there are these jump scares and tension building - especially in our game because it it's so brutal. Obviously these aren't things that you encounter in everyday life. Being able to do that in a game, and have that kind of experience within yourself in a safe place, is what draws people into the genre.</p><p>\"I love doing projects like this, which is funny because whenever I watch other shows with this much gore I'm just such a scardey-cat! I always say 'oh no why would they show that?!'. But whenever I watch my own projects, or am actually doing the scenes, I feel like a sort of comfort. It's just fun to be on set to work on these crazy scenes that make people uncomfortable watching.\"</p><p>The Callisto Protocol has been made by some of the brains behind the Dead Space franchise and is seen as its spiritual successor.</p><p>Whether your a horror fan or not, it is not for the faint-hearted.</p><p>For more gaming content - go to Press X to Continue - the BBC Sounds gaming Podcast.</p>",

        "slug": "taiwan-s-front-line-battle-against-mobile-phone-fraud",
        "content": "<p>Telecoms security boss Jeff Kuo says that fighting mobile phone fraud is a constant battle, and that Taiwan is on the front line.</p><p>\"This is like a miniature of the world, here in Taiwan, where we see all kinds of fraud in advance,\" says Mr Kuo. \"We can use this knowledge to protect other countries, because we can see what is going to happen first.\"</p><p>Mr Kuo is boss of Taiwanese firm Gogolook, which owns Whoscall, one of the most popular spam blocking apps on the island, and across East Asia in general.</p><p>It says its artificial intelligence powered software constantly trawls more than 1.6 billion telephone numbers, both Taiwanese ones, and also ones from across Asia and other parts of the world, to block messages and calls from likely fraudsters.</p><p>Working with Taiwan's Criminal Investigation Bureau's (CIB's) \"165 Anti-Fraud Program\", Whoscall blocked more 52.3 million scam messages, and 13.1 million scam calls, last year in Taiwan alone.</p><p>But why is Taiwan such a hotbed for telecoms fraud? Mr Kuo says the island's small population of 23.5 million makes it a prefect \"practice ground\" for organised criminals, both Taiwanese gangs and those from mainland China and elsewhere. They try out a new phone scam in Taiwan, and if it works there then they can expand it out across Asia and then globally.</p><p>\"[For example], we provide Apple with a lot of evidence... until they realise there is a serious problem,\" says Mr Kuo. \"A problem that is not only going to spread out in Taiwan, but also in Asia Pacific, and if they don't take care of it, very soon it will be in Europe and the US.\"</p><p>CIB telecoms fraud investigator Jean Hsiao Ya-yun tells the BBC that another reason why so many new scams originate on the island is the very fact that Taiwan is one of Asia's top manufacturers of high-tech technology. She says this level of technical expertise is shared by Taiwanese scammers.</p><p>Ms Hsiao adds that the coronavirus pandemic was a boom time for scammers as millions of people were stuck at home, and, therefore, more reliant upon their phones.</p><p>\"And the Taiwan stock market was very high at the time, so many people earned a lot of money,\" she says, adding that this led to a big rise in investment scams.</p><p>\"Scammers would [for example] give advice on app pages, or they would start a chat group saying that they can tell you when a stock is going to rise, and they can share this intel if you join their group.\"</p><p>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.</p><p>The scammers would then ask for money for the information. Other such investment scams would see people receiving phone message from friendly strangers offering loans at very low rates.</p><p>Such is the extent of the criminal networks behind the scamming that some Taiwanese gangs have opened up operations overseas. Ms Hsiao points to one case from 2020 when 92 Taiwanese people were arrested in Montenegro.</p><p>In other cases, Taiwanese people are lured overseas to countries such as Cambodia under the false promise of high wages. There they are forced to work against their will as telephone fraudsters, as the BBC reported in September.</p><p>Mr Kuo admits that there is a \"weapons race\" between anti-fraud firms like his, and the fraudsters. And while Whoscall and similar apps block millions of messages and phone calls, some still get through.</p><p>Anyone who has lived in Taiwan, regardless of age or nationality, is familiar with one method used by fraudsters - burst dialling. Answering an unknown number leads to you hearing a brief dialling sound, and then a pre-recorded message starts playing.</p><p>These calls are made by auto-dial systems capable of making hundreds a minute. It's an effective way for the fraudsters to find the working numbers of people who are prepared to answer their phone despite not knowing who is ringing them.</p><p>Taiwanese cyber security expert TonTon Huang says that once such a person has been found, scammers call back.</p><p>\"If [they find] the number is used by someone, they will sell the active phone data, or tell you that you need to pay a loan, insurance payment, or remit money,\" he says. \"The most common one seems to be about instalment payments, like you shopped online and you need to pay in instalments or something.\"</p><p>While scammers are often looking for older people who might not be familiar with technology or keep up with scam trends, the CIB's Ms Hsiao says they still dupe plenty of young adults as well.</p><p>Earlier this year, a 20-something Taiwanese YouTuber Edison Lin posted a video on the platform in which he emotionally revealed that he had been a victim of telephone fraud.</p><p>He had been conned out of $13,000 [£12,600] by two fraudsters working together.</p><p>Mr Lin said it happened after he was called by someone pretending to an employee of a restaurant he had visited a few months earlier. The man told him that he had accidently been overcharged by $380, and that he would be offered assistance to get the money back.</p><p>After Mr Lin had ended that call he was soon telephoned again, this time by the other fraudster pretending to from his bank.</p><p>\"When the [fake] clerk from E.Sun Bank called, he knew the whole story, he told me how to get compensation from E.Sun,\" Mr Lin said in his video. \"His professionalism made me think he was really a bank clerk.</p><p>\"Before long we were talking back and forth for half an hour... and I noticed one of them was transferring [my] money... I still haven't paid off the debt.\"</p><p>Prof Sandra Wachter, a senior research fellow in AI at Oxford University, is a global expert on the use of AI software systems.</p><p>She says AI can be an effective tool in defending against telecoms and other tech-based fraud, but that the general public also needs to be better educated about the risks.</p><p>\"Technology is being used to scale-up fraud attempts… it allows scammers to cast a wider net and work more efficiently,\" she says. \"At the same time, some people might be more gullible and vulnerable to deceit because texting or calls seem legitimate, especially if executed in convincing and sophisticated ways.</p><p>\"Since fraud is scaling up, the strategy to combat these attempts must too scale up and so it makes sense to deploy AI software for this purpose.</p><p>\"The question is how effective these attempts are, and if we will be able to fully stop this behaviour? And the answer is, probably not, but we can curb it temporarily. Digital literacy and education can help people not to fall into the trap. AI can help to detect these scams and intervene.\"</p><p>Back at spam-blocking app Whoscall, Jeff Kuo agrees, saying fighting fraudsters \"may be never-ending, but so is our determination to sharpen our skills and stand up\".</p>",

        "content": "<p>Like many African doctors, Peter Mativo had to travel overseas to complete his training.</p><p>In 2007 he left Kenya for Bangalore to pursue his goal of becoming a neurologist. After 18 months in India, he returned to Kenya and now works at the Aga Khan University Hospital in Nairobi.</p><p>\"Most of us train in India, as Africa is not a developed continent. We have a very poor economy with no medical infrastructure in place nor specialised training,\" he says.</p><p>\"I would have never been able to get a specialised degree if I would have not opted for India,\" Mr Mativo says.</p><p>India is keen to strengthen such ties with Africa. It has identified the healthcare sector as one area where trade between the continents can flourish.</p><p>So young African doctors are encouraged to finish their training in India, meanwhile Indian healthcare firms are expanding all over Africa.</p><p>\"The African market is a natural fit for Indian pharmaceutical companies, as India is the largest provider of generic medicine in the world,\" says Nisht Dubey.</p><p>Generic drugs made in India can sell at a quarter of the price of a branded equivalent, which makes them a popular choice in less well-off parts of the world.</p><p>\"There is a big gap between demand and supply of medicines in Africa, with a huge disparity among rich and poor,\" says Mr Dubey.</p><p>Spurred by a shortage of medicine and hospital equipment in Kenya during the Covid crisis, Mr Dubey set-up Goodstrain Pharma in 2020. It imports medicine and medical products from all over the world into Kenya.</p><p>Goodstrain's warehouse and corporate offices are in Nairobi, but Mr Dubey wants it to expand across East Africa.</p><p>\"Africa is the only pharmaceutical market where genuinely high growth is still achievable,\" says Mr Dubey, who is originally from Uttar Pradesh in northern India.</p><p>But getting a firm going in Kenya has not been easy. Goodstrain's very first shipment to Kenya was held up at customs for weeks - a major setback for the young firm.</p><p>Mr Dubey says they were not ready for the web of regulations covering imports. Now a third party, which specialises in clearing imports, handles that for them.</p><p>Africure Pharmaceuticals, has gone one step further than Goodstrain, by manufacturing pharmaceuticals in Africa.</p><p>The company, only founded in 2017, already has nine manufacturing facilities in Africa, employing 300 people across Cameroon, Namibia, Botswana and Côte d'Ivoire, with plans to build plants in Ethiopia and Zimbabwe.</p><p>Africure's factories make medications to treat pain, fever, inflammation, malaria, diabetes andhypertension, as well as a wide range of antibiotics.</p><p>\"Africa over the years has been dependent on imports of medication from Europe, India, and China, which has resulted in the draining of precious foreign exchange, non-creation of job opportunities, and suffering the vagaries of supply and demand,\" says Sinhue Noronha, founder and chief executive of Africure Pharmaceuticals.</p><p>Originally from Mumbai, Mr Noronha, hopes his firm will help tackle some of the problems in African healthcare.</p><p>\"Our primary objective is to solve the persistent issues such as affordability, availability, low quality, technological dependence, and reliance on imports.</p><p>\"All of our plants and distribution setups are engaged primarily to provide an uninterrupted supply of essential medicines.\"</p><p>Mr Noronha says that Indian firms have a head start over rivals from elsewhere in the world.</p><p>\"Indian manufacturers and importers are able to understand the African market because of our large diaspora presence in Africa.\"</p><p>Even with those connections, Mr Noronha, has found building a business in Africa a bumpy experience.</p><p>\"The biggest challenge is political instability. I may get a permission today to set up a manufacturing unit, and tomorrow the government or the health minister may resign. One has to be ready for any kind of eventuality,\" he says.</p><p>He also says that personal safety is a consideration.</p><p>\"Security is another big concern. murder and kidnapping are common in Africa. We Indians have to be very careful,\" he says.</p><p>Broadly, Indian healthcare firms have a good reputation in Africa, but that hard won image has recently suffered significant damage.</p><p>Police in The Gambia are investigating the deaths of 66 children, which have been linked to four brands of imported Indian cough syrup.</p><p>In October, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a global alert over the cough syrups - warning they could be linked to acute kidney injuries and the children's deaths in July, August and September.</p><p>\"The Gambia incident is an aberration and we should feel bad about it,\" says Udaya Bhaskar, director general of Pharmexcil, which promotes the export of Indian pharmaceuticals.</p><p>\"This incident will certainly be a dent in our exports and the image of Indian pharma,\" he says.</p><p>But he thinks the reputational damage will be short-lived.</p><p>\"The important factor is that Africa is very dependent on other countries and India produces very good quality medicine, so the Gambia impact will be short-term.\"</p><p>Back in Nairobi, Dr Mativo says the problem is the lack of testing facilities in Africa.</p><p>\"The Gambia incident is sad. The biggest problem is we are not financially strong, nor do we have facilities which can check the standards of medicine supplied to us.\"</p><p>He would like to see more products produced locally.</p><p>\"In Africa most of the population cannot afford branded medicine... what we need is training and setting up manufacturing units in Africa.\"</p>",

Semiconductors are sometimes referred to as the \"brains\" of electronics like smartphones, car components and AI technology.</p><p>Mark Liu, TSMC's chairman, said the firm would build two semiconductor fabrication plants with the first one expected to be online by 2024. The overall investment will be approximately $40bn. It is the largest investment the company has made outside of Taiwan.</p><p>The investment is a boost for Mr Biden following supply chain disruption that has led to chip shortages and amid growing tensions between the US and China.</p><p>The original deal for TSMC to build a plant in the US came in 2020 when President Donald Trump was in office. The latest announcement vastly increases the size of that investment.</p><p>\"Today, we're down to producing only around 10 percent of the world's chips, despite leading the world in research and design in new chip technologies,\" said Mr Biden during a speech in Phoenix on Tuesday.</p><p>The US once made more than 30% of the world's computer chips before the jobs moved overseas, he said.</p><p>\"The United States is better positioned than any other nation to lead the world economy in the years ahead if we keep our focus,\" he added.</p><p>The opening ceremony was attended by several heads of technology companies that rely on TSMC production, such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.</p><p>Apple's Chief Executive Tim Cook said it was a significant moment.</p><p>\"We look forward to expanding this work in the years to come as TSMC forms new and deeper roots in America,\" he said.</p><p>Analysts see TSMC's investment as a potential game changer in the industry.</p><p>\"The TSMC investment is a significant step for US chip investment over the next decade,\" according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. \"This kicks off a legitimate battle between the US and China on chip production with this being a monumental strategic move by TSMC\".</p><p>In August, President Biden signed a law committing $280bn (£232bn) to high tech manufacturing and scientific research amid fears that the US was losing its technological edge to China. The investments include tax breaks for companies that build computer chip manufacturing plants in the US.</p><p>The move came at a time when relations between the two countries have soured.</p><p>This has been fuelled by Beijing's claims over self-ruled Taiwan and its increasing assertiveness in Asia. Beijing sees Taiwan as a part of its territory that must be unified with the mainland, by force if necessary. Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the mainland.</p><p>The US has responded by restricting access to advanced computer chip technology.</p><p>That has hit China's export-driven economy which uses the technology to make and sell everything from phones to electric cars.</p>",

No - it argued that \"AI systems like myself can help writers by providing suggestions and ideas, but ultimately it is up to the human writer to create the final product\".</p><p>Asked what would be the social impact of AI systems such as itself, it said this was \"hard to predict\".</p><p>Had it been trained on Twitter data?

        "content": "<p>London's Vegfest this year was notably smaller and more subdued than in previous years, when queues would snake around the venue.</p><p>It's still the UK's largest indoor vegan event and this year's was the first one since the Covid-19 pandemic started.</p><p>The rising price of food was one frequent topic of conversation. Like many parts of the world, grocery price inflation in the UK is very high, at 14.7% as of the end of October 2022.</p><p>In response, a back-to-basics movement is underway among UK vegans. They're cooking more pulses and grains, buying in bulk, and relying less on the exotic processed products that have proliferated on supermarket shelves in the past few years.</p><p>\"The cost-of-living crisis in the UK has a big impact on food purchasing decisions,\" explains Louisianna Waring, the senior insight and policy officer for the Vegan Society.</p><p>So, if vegans are thinking more carefully about how they spend money, where does this leave companies with innovative plant-based proteins?</p><p>For a while in 2019 and 2020 it seemed like every month brought a plant-based meat, dairy or even fish alternative. The newcomers were trying to appeal to vegans and to non-vegans who were looking to cut down on animal protein.</p><p>But the evidence suggests that interest in the new foodstuffs has declined. Market research firm IRI has found that sales of plant-based meat products fell sharply in the US earlier this year.</p><p>The industry is partly the victim of its own success says Tom Rees, an industry manager at the market research firm Euromonitor.</p><p>He argues that as meat alternatives proliferated in the US during the pandemic, many people tried the lower-quality products and had bad experiences.</p><p>So while wanting a healthier lifestyle might bring the veg-curious to vegan shelves, taste is often what drives them away, Mr Rees says.</p><p>Beyond Meat, was one of the brightest starts of the alternative meat sector. But in its most recent quarter it recorded a loss of almost $15m (£12.4m), and a 23% decline in sales compared with the same period in the previous year.</p><p>Beyond Meat's share price collapsed to a low of $11.56 in November 2022, a 95% fall from its record high of almost $240 in July 2019.</p><p>It expects further losses, and is aiming to recover by lowering prices.</p><p>But although these figures are concerning, we shouldn't place too much emphasis on them, cautions Friederike Grosse-Holz, a plant scientist who is currently a scientific director at Blue Horizon, an investment firm focused on sustainable food.</p><p>\"Some people might have hyped this [sector] more than made sense from a business perspective,\" she acknowledges.</p><p>But she says what we're seeing now isn't a catastrophic decline for plant-based foods, but what she calls a \"return to normal\".</p><p>\"I think it is really coming from a hype to a healthy growth trajectory, rather than a hype to death,\" she says.</p><p>Ms Waring agrees. \"In the last few years we have seen some vegan product categories in the UK see double, and even triple-digit, growth,\" she notes. \"This huge boom was always likely to lead to a slight decline in sales where the market stabilises, innovates, and then increases again.\"</p><p>Another reason for caution in interpreting the data is that sales of meat are down as well. A September 2022 survey of UK adults by the consultancy Public First found that 28% were buying less meat in response to the soaring cost of living.</p><p>Despite the downturn in meat alternatives in the US, plant-based dairy sales remain high. Yet in this sector as well, consumers are increasingly scrutinising health claims. Many people no longer automatically assume that vegan equals nutritious.</p><p>More technology of business:</p><p>In one bright spot for alternative proteins, Ms Grosse-Holz believes that they are well positioned for resilience amid ongoing supply chain issues. They often have shorter supply chains than animal agriculture, as they don't need to rely on the animal feed step.</p><p>They're not completely insulated from world events, of course. For German manufacturers of alternative meats, certain key ingredients remain in short supply following the Russian invasion in Ukraine.</p><p>Retailers are also feeling the pinch, in the face of high energy prices and inflation. The Vegan Kind, the UK's biggest online supermarket dedicated to plant-based products, announced in November that it was ceasing operations, citing the challenging economic climate.</p><p>Overall, however, plant-based producers are heavily pushing to scale up production and drive down costs, in response to consumer demand.</p><p>Developing technologies are helping with that. For instance, producers of plant-based chicken have often used pea protein isolate, for its ease in extrusion - essentially, forcing ingredients through a small opening.</p><p>But improvements in extrusion technology mean that more companies are now able to use pea flour instead, which results in cost savings. It also translates into a food label that many consumers find more relatable.</p><p>\"There is a bunch of magic happening on the product formulation side,\" Ms Grosse-Holz says.</p><p>But, as she emphasises, communication remains key: \"It doesn't help anyone if you have the greatest technological solution to the problem, if people are not going to buy it.\"</p>",

A phone can be used to make payments if the passcode is entered.</p><p>Deborah, Mark and George all said they could not contact Revolut by phone and could only speak to operatives over live chat.</p><p>Mr Elliott-Gross said the Revolut chat function was the most secure way customers could interact with the firm.</p><p>\"Having a call centre isn't a silver bullet,\" he said.</p><p>For more on this story, listen to You and Yours on BBC Sounds.</p>",
